Moreover, an observation\nof the evolution of martensitic transformation typical of NiMnGa ferromagnetic shape memory alloy\nwas conducted in comparison with the cast material behavior and in correlation with the material\ndensiﬁcation. The optimum powder size and sintering time for the process, i.e., 50 µm or lower\nand 72 h, were identiﬁed considering the investigated physical properties of the sintered samples in\ncomparison to the cast material. The corresponding sample showed the best compromise between\ndensity, thermal and electrical properties, and damping and functional behaviour. In general, the\noutcomes of this study could be the basis of a useful tool for production processes that include a\nsintering step as well as being a starting point for the evaluation of an alternative low cost fabrication\nmethod of this alloy.\nKeywords: ferromagnetic shape memory alloys; sintering; martensitic transformation; thermal\nproperties; internal friction; electrical properties\n1. Introduction\nNiMnGa alloys are functional materials that perform a coupling between magnetic and structural\norder and this feature leads to a large magnetic-ﬁeld-induced strain (MFIS), up to 10% in single\ncrystals, caused by the rearrangement of the twin boundaries induced by an applied magnetic ﬁeld [ 1].\nIn addition, materials with speciﬁc compositions could exhibit magnetic superelasticity or shape\nmemory eﬀect and magnetocaloric e ﬀect, when exposed to a magnetic ﬁeld. Ternary Ni 50Mn 25Ga25\nalloy and oﬀ-stoichiometric compounds have attracted increasing interest in several application ﬁelds\nincluding sensor and actuator development, due to their functional properties which are strictly\ncorrelated to crystal structure and phase transformation [ 1]. In recent years, the modulation of the\ngrain structure through shape and size in NiMnGa alloys has attracted increasing interest in order\nto induce an improvement of their functional properties, in particular the magnetic ﬁeld induction\nstrain (MFIS). Furthermore, the presence of space between the grains and their particular shape\nis not a trivial condition for the development of smart behaviour as well as for for polycrystalline\nsamples [ 2]. Hence, increasing attention has been devoted to di ﬀerent sorts of sintering routes. The ﬁrst\nscientiﬁc focus for this development was the preparation of powders of the alloys and the study\nof the relation between the size, the structural properties, and the martensitic transformation [ 3].\nParticularly, hindrance of transformation by means of residual strain induced by mechanical ball\nmillin"

Introduction\nHigh-entropy alloys (HEAs), which contain a high amount of\nalloying elements and tend to stabilize solid solutions due to thecontribution from high con ﬁguration entropy, can exhibit strong solid\nsolution strengthening, nano-precipitation hardening, excellent corro-\nsion and oxidation resistance, and good thermal stability [ 1–5]. How-\never, one challenge to HEAs for industrial applications is their high\nmaterial cost, since most reported HEAs contain a high content of ex-\npensive elements like Co and Ni. Recently, the current authors revealed\nthat the concept of Fe-rich medium-entropy alloy (MEAs), whichMaterials and Design 159 (2018) 224 –231\n⁎Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: huizhang@ahut.edu.cn (H.

Magnesium and its alloys are attractive mate-\nrials for use in automotive and aerospace applications be-\ncause of their low density and good mechanical properties.\nHowever, difﬁculty in forming magnesium and the limited\nnumber of available commercial alloys limit their use. The\npresent work reviews the efforts to improve the attractive-\nness of magnesium through non-traditional processing, and\npresents the results of producing AZ31 magnesium alloy\nvia powder metallurgy P/M. P/M can be used to alleviate\nthe formability problem through near-net-shape processing,\nand also allows unique chemical compositions that can lead\nto the development of new alloys with novel properties.\nThe feasibility of producing magnesium powder metal-\nlurgy products utilizing the industrially dominant process\nof mixed powder blending, uni-axial die compaction and\ncontrolled atmosphere sintering was investigated. An al-\nloy composition based on the commercial Mg alloy AZ31\n(3 mass % Al, 1 mass % Zn) was used to facilitate the com-\nparison to similar wrought product. The optimal processing\nconditions (compaction pressure, sintering time and tem-\nperature) were found to maximize sintered density and me-\nchanical properties.\nResults show that sintering temperature is one of the major\nvariables that has an appreciable effect on the ﬁnal prop-\nerties of the samples, and that the effects of compaction\npressure and sintering time were insigniﬁcant. The mate-\nrial showed poor tensile properties, with a maximum tensile\nstrength of 32 MPa due to lack of sufﬁcient densiﬁcation.\nThe latter was related to the lack of liquid phase formed\nduring sintering of Al/Zn magnesium alloys and the barrier\nto diffusion due to the presence of the stable magnesium\nsurface layer.\nKeywords.

One\nstrategy for the reduction of emissions is reducing the gross\nweight of vehicles. As the weight is decreased, less fuel\nis consumed to propel the vehicle. The average vehicle\nin 1977 had a mass of 1666 kg, and in 2001 the average\nweight had been reduced to 1504 kg; an over 136 kg reduc-\ntion [1]. One of the principal reasons for the weight reduc-\ntion was the increased use of lightweight materials, espe-\ncially aluminum. In the same 24 year period, the average\namount of Al utilized per automobile climbed from 44 kg\nto 116.6 kg. The driving force behind the increased usage\ncan be attributed to the intense research effort put forth to\nprovide over 1600 aluminum alloys from multi-component\nsystems and numerous production and fabrication improve-\nments. More recently, aluminum products processed via\npowder metallurgy (P/M) routes have shown excellent prop-\nerties and are increasing in utilization.\nMagnesium, which has the lowest density of all struc-\ntural metals, has not enjoyed the phenomenal increase in\naverage mass per vehicle that aluminum has, but "

Introduction\nPorous metals exhibit various unique physical properties, including low volumetric density, low\nthermal conductivity, good permeability, high speciﬁc sti ﬀness, and high impact energy absorption [ 1].\nIn particular, the absorption energy of lightweight porous aluminum (Al) under compression has been\nstudied by Koza et al. [ 2] for potential applications in the crumple zones of automobiles. The stable\nplateau stress and large plateau-end strain are required to achieve high impact energy absorption.\nTo improve the energy absorption capability, it is essential to control the structural factors of the\nporosity, pore shape, pore size, and pore distribution [ 3].\nAdditive manufacturing (AM) techniques enable to manufacture complicated shapes from\ncomputer-aided design (CAD) models [ 4,5]. Furthermore, laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is a class of\nAM techniques using a laser beam to melt and fuse layers of metal powder particles forming various\nmetal products with complex shapes, which cannot be manufactured by conventional techniques [ 6].\nWith this concept, LPBF could be a promising route to fabricate open-cell porous metals with controlled\npore structures.

If the surface oxide ﬁ  lm \nis broken, a new thin oxide ﬁ  lm will form immediately, \nthen it will become thicker. However, the broken oxide \nﬁ  lm can be entrained in the bulk liquid by the surface \nturbulence, and some large thick oxide ﬁ  lms are easily \ndetected by non-destructive testing and microscopy in \nthe finished castings [1]. The surface oxide film can be \nfolded to double layers in the entrainment process, and \nthe bonding between the opposed interfaces is negligible, \ncausing the defect to then resemble and act as a crack[2]. \nRecent studies announced that the double oxide film \ndefects, entrained during the filling process when the \nvelocity of liquid aluminum is greater than a critical \ngating velocity, are the main reason for the failure of \naluminum castings [3-5]. Runyoro [6] and Bahreinian [7] \nindicated the critical velocity is 0.5 m ·s-1 in the bottom \ngating system.Abstract: The mold ﬁ  lling behavior of gradual expansion structure in low pressure casting was studied by two \nphase ﬂ  ow model using the Volume of Fluid method, and was veriﬁ  ed by water simulation with a Plexiglas mold. To \nget smooth mold ﬁ  lling process and provide a guide for the pressurizing speed design in the producing practice, the \nmathematical model with the pressurizing speed, expansion angle and height of the gradual expansion structure \nwas established. For validation experiments, ZL205A alloy castings were produced under two different pressurizing \nspeeds. Weibull probability plots were used to assess the fracture mechanisms under different pressurizing \nspeeds. Mechanical properties of ZL205A alloy were applied to assess the entrainment of oxide ﬁ  lm. The results \nshow that the ﬁ  lling process of a gradual expansion structure in a low pressure casting can be divided into the \nspreading stage and ﬁ  lling stage by gate velocity. The gate velocity continues to increase in the gradual expansion \nstructure, and increases with the increase of pressurizing speed or expansion angle. Under the effect of the \nfalling ﬂ  uid raised by the jet ﬂ  ow along the sidewall, the ﬂ  uid velocity decreases in the jet zone from ingate to free \nsurface. As such, oxide ﬁ  lm entrainment does not occur when the gate velocity is greater than the critical velocity, \nandthe gate velocity no longer reﬂ  ects the real state of the free surface. The scatter of the mechanical properties is \nstrongly affected by the entrainment of oxide ﬁ  lms.\nKey words:  low pressure casting; two phase ﬂ  ow; water simulation; oxide ﬁ  lm; ZL205A alloy\nCLC numbers:  TG146.21                    Document code: A                  Article ID: 1672-6421(2018)04-276-07\nLow pressure casting (LPC) is regarded as an eﬀ  ective \nsolution to avoid the entrainment of oxide film [8]. \nHowever, Liu et al. [9] demonstrated that the oxide ﬁ  lm \ncould be entrained during the ﬁ  lling process of a sudden \nexpansion structure at an unreasonable pressurizing \nspeed in LPC process, which is also the case of sudden \ncontraction structure in LPC [10]. It is obvious that the \nﬁ  lling behavior and inclusions in LPC are inﬂ  uenced not \nonly by pressurizing speed but also by the variation of \ncross-section of cavity.\nIn t"

The objective of this study was to develop various composite structures\nof titanium and vanadium oxide (Ti-V-O) coatings on pure titanium through high-temperature\nannealing and laser texturing oxidation, separately; additionally, surface morphologies, tribological\nand hydrophilic properties, and antibacterial and biocompatibility abilities of these Ti-V-O coatings\nwere evaluated. TiV alloy thin ﬁlms were deposited on pure titanium and then annealed to form\nTi-V-O coatings through thermal oxidation and laser texturing oxidation. Ball-on-disc wear tests\nand contact angle tests were conducted to evaluate the tribological properties and wettability of the\ncoatings, respectively. The antibacterial activity of the coatings was estimated by SYTO9 nucleic acid\nstaining with Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive bacteria). The cell cytotoxicity of the coatings\nwas analyzed following the ISO 10995-5:2009 standard with human skin ﬁbroblast cells. The Ti-V-O\ncoatings, subjected to annealing at 700◦C, demonstrated higher hardness (Hv 1171) and a lower\nfriction coefﬁcient (0.6). The highest hardness (Hv 2711) and the lowest friction coefﬁcient (0.52)\nwere obtained for the Ti-V-O after laser surface texturing oxidation at 100 kHz. The oxide coating\nobtained from 100 kHz laser texturing oxidation exhibited the lotus effect because of its systematic\ntextured microstructures, and displayed superhydrophobic surface properties. Compared with\nthe unannealed TiV coating, both the samples with high-temperature annealing and laser surface\ntexturing oxidation had excellent antibacterial properties to Staphylococcus aureus . However, the\nTi-V-O thin ﬁlms exhibited notable cell cytotoxicity. Although the cell viability on Ti-V-O coatings\nwere not ideal, this study conﬁrmed improvement in surface hardness, tribology, and antibacterial\nperformance in Ti-V-O coatings, which may have potential for use in biomedical tools, devices,\nand equipment.\nKeywords: Ti-V-O coatings; annealing; laser texturing; cell viability; tribological performance;\nantibacterial properties\n1.

The inﬂuence of natural aging is dependent\non both processing and compositional variables and has origins that are far from well-understood.\nThis work examines the hardenability of 6000 series alloys under a wide range of conditions, paying\nparticular attention to the natural aging effect. Experimental variables include alloy composition\n(Mg + Si, Mg/Si), cooling rate after solutionization, and duration of prior natural aging. Hardenability\nwas evaluated with full hardness and conductivity aging curves for each condition, as well as select\nTransmission Electron Microscopy (TEM).

Introduction\nWrought aluminum alloys are currently of particular technological interest in the transportation\nindustry due to their high strength to density ratio and relative ease of production. Chieﬂy among\nthese are 6000 series alloys (Al-Mg-Si), which are commonly used as vehicle structural or body\ncomponents [ 1,2]. These alloys gain the majority of their strength through a ﬁne distribution of\nstrengthening particles, which can be precipitated with a dedicated heat treatment or integrated into\nthe manufacturing process.\nThere are two essential components to a precipitation stren gthening treatment: high temperature\nsolutionization (often accompanied by hot deformation), f ollowed by artificial aging (AA) at an\nintermediate temperature (around 175◦C). In practice, the solutionization and artificial aging s teps\nrarely occur in direct succession, so the material is stored intermittently at room temperature for an\nextended period of time. For high strength engineering allo ys, this period of intermittent storage,\nknown as natural aging (NA), has long been known to have a detr imental effect on AA hardenability [ 3–5].\nThis ‘negative NA effect’ is typically due to coarser distri butions and/or lower volume fractions of\nstrengthening precipitates [ 6–14], which is attributed to the prior formation of solute clust ers during NA,\nand a multitude of suggested influences on the AA precipitat ion process [ 15–22].\nNatural aging itself is an exceptionally complicated process, involving several time-dependent\nsteps which have been resolved with measurements of resistivity, Differential Scanning Calorimetry\n(DSC), and Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS) [ 23–31]. In general, the processes "

Gu\nOxidation Behaviors of Inconel 740H in Air\nand Dynamic Steam\nDOI 10.1515/htmp-2014-0242\nReceived December 30, 2014; accepted July 7, 2015\nAbstract: Inconel 740H alloy is a candidate material for\n700°C advanced ultra-supercritical (A-USC) coal-fired\npower plants application as superheater/reheater tube.\nIn this work, oxidation behavior of Inconel 740H alloy\nwas studied in static air at 750°C and 850°C, and in\ndynamic pure steam at 750°C, respectively. The alloy\nwas oxidized approximately following a parabolic law\nin three test environment. In the static air, the oxidation\nrate at 850°C was about 50 times of that at the 750°C.\nMore NiCrMn spinal and TiO 2were detected after oxida-\ntion at 850°C. Cr 2O3, however, was the main oxidation\nproduct at 750°C. In the pure steam, Cr 2O3was still the\nmain oxidation product. The oxidation rate was about 2.6\ntimes of that in static air, but the surface roughness was\nmuch smaller and edges of oxide particles were more\nblurred. There was no evidence of cracks or spallation\nin three test environments.\nKeywords: supercritical, Inconel 740H, oxidation, steam,\nmechanism\nIntroduction\nInconel 740H is a Ni –Cr–Co-based superalloy newly\ndeveloped by the Special Metal Corporation on the\nbasis of Inconel 740 alloy. It is currently being consid-\nered as one of the most potential candidate materials\nused for the boiler (superheater/reheater) in the\nadvanced ultra-supercritical (A-USC) power plant with\nthe steam conditions of 750°C/35 MPa [1]. According tothe requirements of alloys used in the A-USC boiler,\nInconel 740H was designed to have excellent perfor-\nmances with a rupture life of 100,000 h under 750°C/\n100 MPa and maximum corrosion depth to 2 mm in\n200,000 h at 750°C.\nAlloys used for superheater/reheater in power plant\nboilers should have excellent oxidation resistance, espe-\ncially resistance to pure steam oxidation. Based on the\noperating experience of coal-fired power plant, 60% of\nfailures for boiler materials are associated with steam\noxidation and coal-ash corrosion. The poor oxidation\nresistance of austenitic stainless steel currently used in\nthe 600°C/25 MPa ultra-supercritical (USC) boiler is a\nmajor reason for the unplanned shutdown accident of\nplant boiler [2, 3]. Until now, intensive studies have\nbeen performed to observe the microstructure evolution\nand mechanical properties of Inconel 740H during the\nheat treatment or creep tests [4 –6]. But little research on\noxidation resistance of this alloy has been made, espe-\ncially in pure steam environment.\nBased on the current researches, the impact of pure\nsteam could be multifaceted. Researches indicated that a\nprotective Cr 2O3film may be formed for some alloys dur-\ning high temperature exposure at static air [7], but the\nbreakdown of these chromic layer may be occurred in\nsteam atmosphere by the formation of volatile chromium\nspecies, such as CrO 2(OH) 2. According to the research of\nZhao et al. [8], 10% of water vapor in atmosphere plays a\nnegative role during hot explosion for Inconel 740 alloy.\nThe water vapor changed the morphologies of oxide film\nand led to a loose layer structure. Different reasons have\nbeen proposed to explain the negative influence of steam\nduring oxidation. Researchers believed that the OH−and\nHþdecomposed by water vapor may accelerate the diffu-\nsion rate during oxidation [9], microstructural of oxide\nscale could be changed by steam, and then lead to the\nchange of oxidation process [10], the formation of volatile\noxy-hydroxide also accelerated the rupture of oxide film\n[11].

The evolution of residual stress during tempering consists of two\nstages. The ﬁrst stage coincided with cementite precipitation. Under the initial residual stress, the\ntransformation plasticity due to cementite precipitation leads to partial relaxation of the micro-stress\nevoked by the austenite-to-ferrite transformation during quenching. It also caused the material\nsurface and the core to exhibit di ﬀerent residual stress evolution trends. After tempering at 300◦C\nfor 30 min, the residual stress was reduced from 487 MPa to 200 MPa; however, the elastic strain\nenergy remained unchanged. The second stage coincided with alloy carbide precipitation and Mn\npartitioning, but the precipitation of the alloy carbide only reduced the elastic strain energy by 8.7%.\nThus, the change in activation energy was the main reason for the relaxation of residual stress at this\nstage. After tempering at 600◦C for 30 min, the residual stress was reduced to 174 MPa, the elastic\nstrain energy was reduced by 72.72%, and the residual stress was controlled.\nKeywords: residual stress; tempering; transformation plasticity; carbide precipitation\n1. Introduction\nAs a mature structural material, low-carbon, micro-alloyed, high-strength steel is widely used\nin energy, transportation, construction, and other industries. In order to reduce the material cost\nand improve the welding performance, grain-boundary strengthening, precipitation strengthening,\nand phase transformation strengthening has become the main way to develop high-strength steel\nmaterials [ 1]. However, the resulting residual stress [ 2,3] frequently causes problems including a\ndecrease in material fatigue performance, deformation during processing, and stress corrosion.\nResearch has focused on reducing the internal stress of quenching and obtaining high-strength steel\nproducts with stable structures and ideal properties [ 4,5]. Vieira [ 6] used a non-isothermal tempering\ndilatation test and Mössbauer spectrometer to study the tempering process of medium-carbon steel\nand determined the main reaction stage in the tempering process.

The TST refers to one pass at 200◦C followed by\nfurther successive pressing at RT. It is shown that this method is e ﬀective in obtaining the combination\nof high strength and electrical conductivity. After two passes, the higher strength can be achieved in\nTST condition (328 MPa yield strength and 331 MPa ultimate tensile strength), where the changing\nparameter is processing temperature from the ﬁrst pass at 200◦C to the second pass at RT, as compared\nto two passes in RT condition (241 MPa yield strength and 250 MPa ultimate tensile strength) and\ntwo passes in 200◦C condition (239 MPa yield strength and 258 MPa ultimate tensile strength). This\nperformance could be associated with grain reﬁnement and nanosized precipitates in TST condition.\nMoreover, in contrast to RT condition, a higher electrical conductivity was observed in TST condition.\nIt reveals that high strength and electrical conductivity of 6063 aluminum alloy can be obtained\nsimultaneously by ECAP processing in TST condition because of ultraﬁne-grained microstructure\nand nanosized precipitates.\nKeywords: aluminum alloy; severe plastic deformation; precipitation; strength; electrical conductivity\n1. Introduction\nSevere plastic deformation (SPD) techniques, such as equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) and\nhigh-pressure torsion (HPT), are e ﬀective in reﬁning grain size down to submicron-meter or nanometer\nrange through inducing intense shear strain, and hence lead to high strength [ 1]. A reduction of\ngrain size results in a signiﬁcant increase in strength according to the Hall–Petch relationship at low\ntemperatures [ 2–4]. Pure metals and non-heat-treatable alloys in ultraﬁne-grained (UFG) structure\nthrough SPD processing can obtain high strength, which could be associated with grain reﬁnement\nand high dislocation density [ 4,5]. For heat-treatable alloys, precipitation hardening plays a key\nrole in a further enhancement in strength. The combination e ﬀect of grain reﬁnement, dislocation\nentanglements, and precipitations on the strength has attracted considerable attention. In addition,\nthe amount of strain and temperature are important SPD parameters to determine grain reﬁnement,\nsolute distribution, deformation-induced precipitation and mechanical properties [ 6]. It has been\nobserved that increasing processing temperature leads to an increase in grain size [ 7,8]. However,\ndynamic precipitation assisted by high density of dislocations and vacancies during SPD processing\nat elevated temperature can impede coarsening of grains [ 9,10]. Most previously reported studies\non SPD of heat-treatable alloys usually employ an invariable temperature during consecutive SPD\nproces"

In  this  present  investigation,  backward  cup  extrusion  of  AA6063  was  suc-\ncessfully carried  out  experimentally  and  theoretically  using  tropical  coconut  oil  and  castor\noil  as  lubricants.  The  experiment  was  also  carried  out  without  lubrication.  With  the  different\nlubricating  conditions,  the  strain  rate  was  varied  at  1.5  ×  10−3s−1,  2.0  ×  10−3s−1,  2.5  ×  10−3s−1\nand  3.0  ×  10−3s−1respectively.  A  numerical  analysis  using  DEFORM  3D  software  for  backward\ncup  extrusion  at  strain  rates  of  2.0  ×  10−3s−1and  2.5  ×  10−3s−1were  then  performed  to  deter-\nmine optimum  lubricated  condition  and  temperature  distribution  during  the  deformation.\nIt was  found  that  the  temperature  increased  with  increasing  strain  rates.  At  a  higher  strain\nrate, the  temperature  of  both  punch  and  lower  die  also  increased.  The  highest  temperature\nwas observed  when  lubricated  with  tropical  coconut  oil  at  a  strain  rate  of  3.0  ×  10−3s−1which\nwas observed  to  be  above  33◦C  when  compared  to  other  lubricants.  The  punch  tempera-\nture showed  a  higher  temperature  compared  to  the  lower  die  temperature  in  all  cases.

Introduction\nTo improve the high-temperature mechanical and chemical properties, the nickel-based superalloy\nfamily has been developed signiﬁcantly over the past several decades by chemical composition\noptimization. Therefore, the γ′-strengthened nickel-based superalloys are highly alloyed material\nsystems. With the nickel acting as the austenitic matrix, it is doped with up to 10 or more\nalloying elements [ 1,2]. The addition of these alloying elements primarily serves the purpose of\nimproving high-temperature performance. Generally, the mechanical performance is associated with\nthe combination of the precipitation hardening e ﬀect from the ordered L1 2γ′intermetallic phase\nand the solid solution strengthening e ﬀect from refractory elements slowly di ﬀusing at elevated\ntemperature. For the chemical properties, it is strongly related to the formation of protective oxide\nlayers during high-temperature applications. Owing to the excellent high-temperature properties\nand wide engineering application of nickel-based superalloys, the fabrication of superalloy parts by\nthe promising additive manufacturing (AM) techniques is of great interest. Extensive investigations\nhave been done regarding the AM process tailoring, the post-process treatments, and characterization\nof high-temperature mechanical and chemical properties of a group of γ′precipitate-strengthened\nnickel-based superalloys, such as IN939 [ 3], IN738LC [ 4–6], and CM247LC [ 7,8]. The compositions\nof these superalloys were proposed decades ago but, unfortunately, they were not developed with\nthe intention of being adopted for AM processes.\nBased on this, the need for novel chemical compositions of nickel-based superalloys ready for\nAM processing is urgent. However, the AM processing of precipitation-strengthened nickel-based\nsuperalloys is a great challenge, owing to its intrinsic cracking susceptibility during the AM\nprocess and/or the associated post-processing treatment. Four critical cracking mechanisms of\nprecipitate strengthened nickel-based superalloys summarized from the welding literature below are\ngenerally accepted:\nMaterials 2020 "

AA2195 was taken as the\nrepresentative of Al-Cu-Li alloys. It is found that the total creep strain and strength property of\ncreep aged AA2195 specimens can be improved through effecti ve pre-stretching. Unlike with artificial\naging, yield strength increased increasing by 47%. The TEM i mages show that the constitution of aging\nprecipitates in the creep-aged specimens are obviously changed by pre-stretching. Precipitates\nin the 2% pre-stretched specimen are mainly composed of T 1phase, while a great amount\nofθ’ phase accompanied with a few T 1phase were found in the non-pre-stretched specimen.\nMoreover, pre-stretching introduces many dislocations which beneﬁt the creep deformation, but the\nincreasing dislocation density also accelerates the nucleation and growth of the precipitates as well.\nThe premature T 1phase has a great blocking effect to the dislocation motion, creating a lower decrease\nrate but a longer duration in the early creep stage. Except for the initial dislocations, the dislocation\nmotion in the creep aging process is also a favorable factor to precipitate the T 1phase.\nKeywords: Al-Cu-Li alloy; creep aging; pre-stretching; microstructure; mechanical property\n1. Introduction\nAs one of the currently popular aeronautic and astronautic structural materials, Al-Cu-Li alloys\nhave received worldwide attention and been developed rapidly in relevant production and application\nfor their valuable combination of properties, such as low weight, high modulus and high speciﬁc\nstrength [ 1–3]. As an excellent representative of Al-Cu-Li alloys, AA2195 has replaced the incumbent\nstructural material (AA2219) for the cryogenic fuel tank on the space shuttle, as it provides an effective\nway of lowering the structural weight. In general, the T 1phase formed in aluminum {111} planes is\nconsidered as the primary strengthening phase in Al-Cu-Li alloys [ 4–6].\nPlastic deformation prior to aging enhances the aging kinetics and increases the number density\nof ﬁne strengthening precipitates through the introduction of dislocations acting as preferential\nheterogeneous matrix nucleation sites for the T 1phase [ 7]. Cassada et al. [ 8] found that the volume\nfraction of ﬁne matrix T 1phase is enhanced by the effect of pre-deformation. Kim et al. [ 9] also found\nthat the stretching treatment greatly accelerated the nucleation kinetics of the T 1phase at the expense\nof S’ phases. Gable et al.

It is  confirmed that the entropy change evolves \nas a consequence of the va riations on the degree of L2 1 atomic order brought by thermal \ntreatments, though, contrary to what occurs  in ternary Ni-Mn-In, post-quench aging \nappears to be the most effective way to modi fy the transformation en tropy in Ni-Mn-In-Co. \nIt is also shown that any entropy change  value between around 40 and 5 J/kgK can be \nachieved in a controllable way for a single alloy under the appropriate aging treatment, \nthus bringing out the possibility of properly tune the magnetocaloric effect. \nKeywords:  Ni-Mn-In-Co; entropy change; atomic  order; martensitic transformation; \nmetamagnetic shape memory alloys \n OPEN ACCESS\nPage 2:\nEntropy 2014 , 16 2757 \n \n 1. Introduction \nNi-Mn-based Heusler alloys ex hibiting both long-ra nge magnetic ordering and thermoelastic \nmartensitic transformation (MT) have been intens ively investigated in recent years, from both \nfundamental and applied points of view, due to the unique properties th ey show linked to the \noccurrence of a first-order marten sitic transformation (MT) between magnetically ordered phases [1]. \nThe magnetism in these alloys mainly arises from  the coupling between the Mn atoms (in which the \nmagnetic moment is chiefly confined), so the magne tic exchange interactions  strongly depend on the \nMn-Mn distance [2], and therefore different sequen ces of magnetostructural transformations can be \nobserved depending on both the X element and the cha nge in interatomic distances caused by the MT. \nIn particular, in the so-called me tamagnetic shape memory alloys, Ni 2Mn 1-xZ1+x (Z=In, Sn, and Sb), the \nMT takes place between ferromagnetic austenite a nd a weak magnetic martensitic phase due to \nweakening of the excha nge interactions (competing ferroma gnetic and antiferromagnetic) [3–8].  \nThe large change of magnetization, ΔM, occurring at the MT in this ca se allows the induction of the  \nMT by an applied magnetic field, thus giving ri se to multifunctional properties (namely giant \nmagnetoresistance [9–12] magnetic shape memory [13], or large invers e magnetocaloric effect [14,15] of \ngreat technical interest for "

Introduction\nIncreasingly, the composite materials of aluminium matrix \nalloy are applied to the production of structural components \nand machine parts, such as slide bearings, brake discs, sleeves \nand pistons [1,2]. The strong interest in this kind of composite \nmaterials are result from a number of their creative properties, \nwhich can be designed by the proper selection of reinforcing \ncomponents, chemical composition of aluminium matrix and \ntechnological parameters. In most theoretical and experimental \nstudies the authors proves that the presence of the hard of \nceramic reinforcement (i.e: SiC, Al 2O3) has a beneficial effect \non the properties of Al matrix alloy, particularly on its hardness, \nwear resistance, thermal conductivity and thermal expansion \nas well as on dimensional stability [3-6]. Unfortunately, at the \nsame time increase wear and reducing the durability of cutting \ntools were observed [7-9]. Therefore, most of the new studies \nfocus on the formation of structure and properties of hybrid \ncomposites [9-16]. Such composites (i.e: Al/SiC-Cg or Al/SiC-\ngraphite) have better physical, mechanical and tribological \nproperties than the composites, which are reinforced by only \none type of reinforcements [12]. It has been shown that graphite \nparticles may create a protective lubricating layer between two \ncontact surfaces during sliding [11]. The possibility to obtain \nof lubrication effect is very important and useful from the point \nof view of the machining of the finished composite product. \nMoreover the new composite material designed for pistons \nmust have the proper thermal expansion and conductivity, \ngood thermal shock resistance, suitable of tribological \nproperties, advantageous mechanical properties, in particular \nfatigue strength, appropriate hardness, low density and \ndamping capacity [17]. For this purpose the proper selection \nof both the chemical composition of the matrix and the type, \nsize and volume fraction of reinforcing phase and more over the selection of technological parameters are necessary. \nFor all casting processes the aluminium matrix alloy \nshould characterized high strength, possibility to heat treatment \nand good technological properties, such as a high castability, \nlow viscosity and first of all good wettability on ceramic \nsurface reinforcement. The poor wetting and reactivity between \nliquid Al alloy and ceramic particles such as silicon carbide \n(SiC), graphite (GR) and glassy carbon (Cg) are primary \nproblems during the production of composite suspensions [14-\n21]. The wetting conditions can be improved by addition of \nproper alloying elements to the liquid aluminium alloy, the \nadequate preparing of surface reinforcement particles as well \nas through decreasing temperature and shortening the time of \ntechnological process.\nIn several studies have been shown that strontium (Sr) \nadded to Al-Si casting alloys in order to change silicon crystals \nmorphology what causes increases mechanical properties of \nthe casts [22-24]. Razaghia et al. [24] demonstrated that the \nSr addition has improved tensile strength and elongation in \nAl-Si matrix composites containing SiC and Al 2O3 particles. \nThey found that this could be attributed to the silicon crystal \nmodification and wettability improvement of particle-matrix \ninterface. As was shown the Sr segregates on both the silicon \ncarbide and alumina particles and promotes the formation of \nan Al–Si–Sr intermetallic compound on the particle-matrix \ninterface.

Thus, prediction of this dissolution and precipitation \nbehavior is key for the development of effective manufacturing strategies. In this study, the kinetics of the \ndissolution and precipitation phenomena of the γ phase in Fe-Cr-Ni alloy were investigated using the kinetic \nconstants derived by the phase –field method, and the α/γ phase fraction of the multi-pass welds was theoretically \ninvestigated. The kinetics of the dissolution and precipitation phenomena were evaluated theoretically and \nexperimentally through optical and scanning electron microscopy. DSSs with different compositions were \nevaluated to achieve satisfactory correlation. The temperature dependences of the experimental and calculated \nvalues were found to be in good agreement, indicating that it is possible to theoretically predict the dissolution \nand precipitation phenomenon of the γ phase by using the phase-field method presented herein. With regard to \nthe α/γ phase fraction, there was a remarkably high correlation between the results predicted using the kinetic \nconstant of the experimental value and those predicted using the kinetic constant derived from the phase –field \nmethod. Therefore, the kinetics-based theoretical results of this study could serve as a resource for predicting the \nγ phase amount of multi –pass welds in DSSs.   \nIntroduction \nThe microstructural evolution of a system occurs owing to a ten-\ndency for reduction in the total free energy of the system under non- \nequilibrium conditions. The traditional approach used to model the \nevolution of the microstructure of a material treats regions that separate \ndifferent domains as zero-thickness regions (sharp interface between \ndomains). The motion of this sharp interface explains the kinetics to-\nward equilibrium. However, a sharp interface model is difficult to \nimplement because it requires a solution to the diffusion equation ac-\ncording to the moving boundary conditions at the interface. This \napproach in which the interface (boundary) must be determined as part \nof the solution is commonly referred to as the free boundary problem. \nThe free boundary approach can succeed in changing the topology with \nsimple geometries, but it is impractical for more complex two-or three- \ndimensional systems. Recently, a more convenient method of phase –-\nfield simulation of microstructure evolution and phase transformation \nhas become a powerful tool. This is because there are useful frameworks \nthat include a static approach based on the total free energy of the microstructure and a kinetic approach that explains the evolution of \ncomplex microstructures ( Koyama and Onodera, 2003 ; Koyama, 2004 ; \nChen, 2002 ; Boettinger et al., 2002 ).

The coarsening kinetics\nare adequately characterised by the classical Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner model for Ostwald ripening. Co-\n7Al-7W exhibited much slower coarsening than its quaternary derivatives. Alloying can be exploited\nto modify the coarsening kinetics either by increasing the solvus temperature by adding tantalum, or by\nadding nickel to shift the rate controlling mechanism towards dependence on the diffusion of aluminium\nrather than tungsten. Lattice resolution STEM imaging was used to measure the widths of the order-\ndisorder (structural) and Z-contrast (compositional) gradients across the g/g0interfaces. Similarly to\nnickel base superalloys, the compositional gradient was found to be wider than the structural. Co-7Al-\n7W-20Ni had much wider interface gradients than Co-7Al-7W and Co-10Al-5W-2Ta, which suggests\nthat its g0phase stoichiometry is less constrained. A possible correlation between temperature and mis ﬁt\nnormalised rvs.t1/3coarsening rate coef ﬁcients and the structural gradient width has also been iden-\ntiﬁed, whereby alloys with wider interfaces exhibit faster coarsening rates.\n©2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

This is particularly true in regard to their effect\non the mechanical behaviour of multi-phase alloy systems. Super-\nalloys, widely used in the manufacture of high-temperature turbine\ncomponents for jet engines, are no exception [4]. Their micro-\nstructure consists of a fccsolid solution matrix, g, strengthened by\nan intermetallic phase, g0, with an L1 2ordered structure. The vol-\nume fraction of the g0is as high as 80% in some alloys.\nTheg/g0interface is an important physical boundary that in-\nteracts with the dislocations responsible for the plastic deformation\nof the alloys. Depending on the speci ﬁc stress-temperature regime\nexperienced by these materials [5], the dislocations either pass\nthrough the interface to shear the precipitates [6], or become\ntrapped in the interface and are forced to circumvent the pre-\ncipitates via thermally activated climb and cross-slip [7].\nThe lattice mis ﬁt between the gandg0is the most thoroughlystudied interfacial property in superalloys. The associated strain\nﬁeld has been exploited by metallurgists to attain strength im-\nprovements [8]. However, excessive strains destabilise the micro-\nstructure by promoting directional coarsening (rafting) at elevated\ntemperatures [9,10] . Furthermore, addition of certain refractory\nelements to increase the lattice mis ﬁt favours the formation of\nbrittle topologically close packed phases that denude th"

The microstructures were further\nanalyzed by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).\nThe results show that temperature and stress can obviously affect the creep behavior, mechanical\nproperties, and fatigue life of Al-Cu-Mg alloy. As the aging temperature increases, the fatigue\nlife of alloy ﬁrst increases, and then decreases. The microstructure also displays a transition from\nthe Guinier-Preston-Bagaryatsky (GPB) zones to the precipitation of S phase in the grain interior.\nHowever, the precipitation phases grow up and become coarse at excessive temperatures. Increasing\nstress can narrow the precipitation-free zone (PFZ) at the grain boundary and improve the fatigue\nlife, but overhigh stress can produce the opposite result. In summary, the fatigue life of Al-Cu-Mg\nalloy can be improved by ﬁne-dispersive precipitation phases and a narrow PFZ in a suitable creep\naging process.\nKeywords: Al-Cu-Mg alloy; creep aging; fatigue fracture behavior; microstructure\n1. Introduction\nCreep aging forming is a kind of forming method using the combination of the creep deformation\nof metal and the aging of aluminum alloy, which is mainly used for manufacturing aircraft wing panels\nand other integral panel components. This method is of better forming precision and repeatability than\nthat of conventional plastic forming, which reduces the possibility of material fracture in the process\nand the residual stress in the components [ 1–5]. In recent years, the research on the formation of creep\naging has mainly focused on how to improve microstructures, mechanical properties, or forming\nprecision. Ho et al. [ 6] presented a creep damage constitutive equation for creep aging through forming\na springback simulation that considered precipitation phases change in view of the 7010 aluminum\nalloy. Zhan [ 7] improved on that model, and built a set of constitutive models that can simulate the\nchange of creep strain, precipitation phase, dislocation strengthening, solid solution strengthening,\naging reinforcement, and material properties of the forming process in combination with the creep\nunidirectional tensile test. Xu et al. [ 8] compared the precipitation behaviors of 2124 aluminum alloy\nunder several aging forming conditions, ﬁnding that the key mechanism of the generation and control\nof the precipitation orientation effect of 2124 aluminum alloy lies in the effect of dislocation.

LPBF materials have microstructural defects, such as suboptimal grain size and morphology, and\nmacroscale anomalies, such as lack of fusion. This results in LPBF components performing below their wrou ght\ncounterparts for various mechanical properties, such as creep which has seldom been researched. To u nderstand\nthe creep behaviour of LPBF alloy 718, parts were fabricated using different scanning strategies and build orien-\ntations and creep tested at 650 °C under a 600 MPa load. Heat treatment increased the creep life by a fact or of 5,\nconﬁrming its necessity. The build orientation and stress state were shown to be determining factors in the creep\nfailure mechanisms. The Meander scanning strategy resulted in a 58% increase in creep life compared to the\nStripe strategy, due to the detrimental effects of the numerous laser overlapping regions in the Stripe st rategy.\nFor a given strategy, a 24% increase in creep life compared to wrought alloy 718 was observed, indicating that\nLPBF has the potential to surpass wrought material properties. As a result of this work, it is possi ble to propose\nbuild strategies for high temperature creep applications.\n© 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Solution heat treatment on a hot extruded Mg-Dy-Nd-Zn-Zr (RESOLOY®) was\ndone to change the initial ﬁne-grained microstructure, consisting of grain boundary blocky LPSO\nand lamellar LPSO structures within the matrix, into coarser grains of less lamellar and blocky LPSO\nphases. C-ring compression tests in Ringer solution were used to cause a fracture. Crack initiation\nand propagation is inﬂuenced by twin boundaries and LPSO lamellae. The blocky LPSO phases also\nclearly hinder crack growth, by increasing the energy to pass either through the phase or along its\ninterface. The microstructural features were characterized by micro- and nanohardness as well as the\namount and location of LPSO phases in dependence on the heat treatment condition. By applying\nnanoindentation, blocky LPSO phases show a higher hardness than the grains with or without\nlamellar LPSO phases and their hardness decreases with heat treatment time. On the other hand, the\nmatrix increases in hardness by solid solution strengthening. The microstructure consisting of a good\nbalance of grain size, matrix and blocky LPSO phases and twins shows the highest fracture energy.\nKeywords: magnesium; Mg-Dy-Nd-Zn-Zr; RESOLOY®; LPSO phases; crack propagation; hard-\nness; nanoindentation\n1.

Changes in the microstructure due to thermomechanical treatment were reﬂected\nin changes in the damping. Internal friction is inﬂuenced by the dislocation substructure and its\nmodiﬁcation due to solute atoms migration, microplastic deformation, and twins’ formation. Internal\nfriction in the rolled sheets is affected by the rolling texture.\nKeywords: internal friction; magnesium alloy; thermal cycling; dislocations; twinning\n1. Introduction\nThe amplitude-dependent internal friction (ADIF) is usually explained by the Granato and Lücke\nmodel (G-L model). This model in its original form, published in the 1950s [ 1,2], was constructed\nfor “pure“ metals loaded at very low temperatures; for movable dislocations in the slip plane and\ntheir break-away from the static pinning points (usually solute atoms, point defects or their small\nclusters). Later, the G-L model was customized several times with the aim to express further aspects of\nthis process, such as the thermally-activated break-away of dislocations, dragging of solute atoms by\nthe dislocation segments or diffusive movement of solute atoms at elevated temperatures [ 3–9]. It is\ninteresting to note the idea by Gremaud who applied the Brownian motion of overdamped dislocations\njumping over localized obstacles distributed on the dislocation glide plane for an explanation of\nthe interaction with point defects [ 10]. Authors of many papers concerning ADIF usually apply the\noriginal G-L model in the simplest form and, also, in the case of concentrated alloys [ 11], sometimes\nthis model is not applicable. This depends on the material microstructure, mobility of solute atoms,\ntheir distribution (isolated solute atoms, their small clusters, precipitates, particles of the second phase).\nThe microstructure may be changed by thermal and mechanical treatments [ 12,13] and, conversely,\nsuch changes must be reﬂected by the internal friction behaviour. Magnesium alloys of the AZ series\n(Mg-Al-Zn) are mostly used for industrial applications. With increasing Al content, the strength of\nthe alloys increase, while lower Al content is favourable for material plasticity. AZ31 magnesium\nalloy is in the focus of design engineers. Data concerning the ADIF of magnesium alloys of the AZ\nseries were reported in a number of papers [ 14–18]. Authors tried to ﬁnd the link between damping\nbehaviour and the alloy’s microstructure and its changes. Note that these attempts did not give a\ncomprehensive view of this problem. The main goal of this study was applying the ADIF to investigate\nthe microstructure and its evolution in the cast and rolled AZ31 magnesium alloy after thermal and\nmechanical treatments with the aim to elucidate the details of micro"

Introduction\nDemanding applications including aerospace technology require state-of-the-art materials such\nas ultra-high permeability alloys with quasistatic maximum relative permeability µexceeding 250,000.\nSuch materials are especially suitable for ﬂuxgate sensors for precision measurements of magnetic\nﬁelds [ 1–3]. It should be highlighted that, until now, over 200 ﬂuxgate magnetometers were used\nin space research. During a past project concerned with the design of low-noise magnetic ﬂuxgates,\nthe modiﬁed MELTA®MM-5Co amorphous alloy was chosen for the core of the device [ 4]. Reference [ 5]\ndescribes a low-noise (<1 pT) sensor based on similar amorphous material. Trying to apply this\namorphous material in three-axis sensors was met with problems of excitation voltage unbalance.\nThis could happen if the pieces of tape for each core are taken from different bobbins (even annealed in\nthe same batch) or even from different parts of the same bobbin. For instance, from the inner, middle,\nand upper part of the bobbin. The following investigation is a follow-up of this project.\nWhile it is common practice to construct such devices and investigate their functional\ncharacteristics later, the process of design optimization needs precise methods of computer modeling\nthat allow us to ﬁnd the best solution from a number of variables including geometric parameters\nof magnetic circuits. The correct model of the magnetic hysteresis loop is essential for optimization\naccuracy [ 6].

The alloys were produced by vacuum induction\nmelting and electro-slag refining (VIM þESR) process and\nthen they were hot rolled. After heat treatment, micro-\nstructures and 650°C tensile properties of specimens were\ninvestigated. Phase analysis with X-ray diffraction (XRD)\nindicated that Incoloy 901 contained Metallic carbides\n(MC)-type carbide enriched with Ti and Mo. With increas-\ning carbon content from 0.02 to 0.09 wt%, carbide area\nfraction increased from 0.73% to 1.2%. Also, increasing\nof carbon content gave rise to higher amounts of\ncarbide sizes. Using XRD patterns, the lattice parameters\nofγand γ′phases were determined and the results\nshowed that, with increase of carbon content, the lattice\nparameters of γand γ′phases decreased and the mis-\nmatch between them increased from 0.119% for alloy\ncontaining 0.02 wt% to 0.167% for alloy containing\n0.09 wt% C.

One of the most\npopular austenitic heat-resistant superalloy is Incoloy 901\nwhich has widespread uses for parts such as turbine disks,\nshafts and rotors and requires high strength of up to 760°C\nand oxidation resistance of up to 870°C [1 –4]. Therefore,\nresearch interest to improve the performance characteristics\nof Incoloy 901 is going on [5, 6]. The precipitation hard-\nening process applied for these alloys gives rise to interest-\ning mechanical properties. These alloys are strengthened\nby the presence of Ti, Al and C. The improvement of\nmechanical properties mainly relies on proper selection\nand design of the main alloy composition and/or additives\nand development of appropriate microstructure and\nphase(s) through appropriate heat-treatment conditions. It\nis shown that the appropriate h eat treatment of this family\nof alloys produces an ultrafine precipitate in nanometric\nsize of γ′phase in a face-centered cubic (FCC) matrix [2].\nAdding proper amount of carbon to superalloys can\nimprove their strength. Carbon atoms occupy interstitial\nsites in FCC lattice and result in solution strengthening.\nCarbon also combines with reactive elements such as Ti to\nform carbide. Carbides play an important role in superalloy.\nThe carbides act to impede deformation when they are in a\ngrain. For high-temperature alloys, however, their most\nimportant role is to inhibit the movement of grain bound-\naries, which tend to slide when being stressed above about\n0.5 of the absolute melting point. Carbides must be suitably\ndispersed along the boundarie s and reasonably stable when\na component is put into elevated temperature service [1 –3].\nVarious works have reported the effects of carbide\nprecipitating on the mechanical properties of superalloys\n[7–13]. By controlling and improving size, morphology\nand distribution of carbides in superalloys, their strength\ncan be improved [10 –12].

First, the coatings were teste d in a 400 °C steam autoclave for 72 h as an\naccelerated method to simulate the normal LWR operating conditions. In these tests, both coatings resulted in\nnotable improvements in oxidation resistance compared to the Zr-all oy, with the higher Cr containing coating\nexhibiting a thinner oxide layer. Both coatings provided good oxidation r esistance when tested in 1200 °C\nambient air environment; however, the formation of a low melting poi nt eutectic (~928 °C) between Fe and Zr\nresulted in significant melting associated with inter-diffusion betw een Fe in the coating and the Zr in the sub-\nstrate. Therefore, to take advantage of the superior oxidation resistan ce that FeCrAl coatings can provide, a Mo\ninterlayer was deposited, also by the cold spray process, in-between th e protective FeCrAl coating and the Zr-\nalloy substrate, thus creating a dual cold spray layer accident toler ant coated cladding concept. The wear re-\nsistance of the FeCrAl coating was superior to the Zr-alloy substrate base d on pin-on-disk wear tests, providing\nan indication of the benefits of such coatings to reduce grit-to-rod fre tting (GTRF) damage. The feedstock\npowders, microstructure, phases, hardness of coatings, as well as oxide and inter-diffusion layers of oxidized\ncoatings were examined using SEM, XRD, and XPS characterization te chniques.\n1. Introduction\nZirconium-alloys (referred to henceforth as Zr-alloys) have been\nsuccessfully used as cladding materials for light water reactors (LWR s)\nfor many decades due to their good corrosion resistance at operating\ntemperatures and low absorption cross section of thermal neutrons [1].\nHowever, during accident conditions, including a loss-of-coolant acci-\ndent (LOCA), the temperature in the reactor can rise due to decay heat,\ncausing the Zr-alloy cladding to readily oxidize in reaction with the\nwater coolant or steam [2]. This can result in temperatures rising up to\n1200 °C and higher and cause the Zr-alloy cladding to react exother-\nmically with steam to produce combustible hydrogen gas. This situation\nis currently being addressed by nuclear industries and research in-\nstitutions through development of accident tolerant fuel (ATF) con-\ncepts. The general goal of all ATF concepts is to tolerate an acciden tal\nloss of active cooling in the reactor core while at the same time main-\ntaining or even improving fuel performance during normal operatin g\nconditions [3]. ATF concepts being investigated include complete re-\nplacement of Zr-alloy cladding with more oxidation-resistant materia lssuch as FeCrAl alloys or SiC-SiC composites [4].

The aim of the work was to study and develop\nthe physicochemical basis for obtaining complex-alloyed nickel aluminides and their application\nfor enhancing the properties of coatings made by electrospark deposition (ESD) on steel castings,\nas well as their use as grain reﬁners for tin bronze. The peculiarities of microstructure formation of\nmaster alloys based on the Al–TM (transition metal) system were studied using optical, electronic\nscanning microscopy and X-ray spectral microanalysis. There were regularities found in the formation\nof structural components of aluminum alloys (Ni–Al, Ni-Al-Cr, Ni-Al-Mo, Ni-Al-W, Ni-Al-Ti,\nNi-Cr-Mo-W, Ni-Al-Cr-Mo-W-Ti, Ni-Al-Cr-V , Ni-Al-Cr-V-Mo) and changes in their microhardness,\ndepending on the composition of the charge, which consisted of oxide compounds, and on the amount\nof reducing agent (aluminum powder). It is shown that all the alloys obtained are formed on the basis\nof theβphase (solid solution of alloying elements in nickel aluminide) and quasi-eutectic, consisting\nof theβ′phase and intermetallics of the alloying elements. The most effective alloys, in terms\nof increasing microhardness, were Al-Ni-Cr-Mo-W (7007 MPa) and Al-Ni-Cr-V-Mo (7914 MPa).\nThe perspective is shown for applying the synthesized intermetallic master alloys as anode materials\nfor producing coatings by electrospark deposition on steel of C1030 grade. The obtained coatings\nincrease the heat resistance of steel samples by 7.5 times, while the coating from NiAl-Cr-Mo-W alloy\nremains practically nonoxidized under the selected test conditions. The use of NiAl intermetallics as\na modifying additive (0.15 wt. %) in tin bronze allows increasing the microhardness of the α-solid\nsolution by 1.9 times and the microhardness of the eutectic ( α+βphase) by 2.7 times.\nKeywords: intermetallic compounds; aluminothermic reduction; alloying elements; microhardness;\nmicrostructure; solid solutions; quasi-eutectic; electrospark deposition\nMetals 2018 ,8, 439; doi:10.3390/met8060439 www.mdpi.com/journal/metals\nPage 2:\nMetals 2018 ,8, 439 2"

Three laser power densities\n(3.2 GW/cm2, 4.8 GW/cm2and 6.4 GW/cm2) of LSP were chosen and tested using manufactured\nfretting fatigue apparatus. The experimental results show that the LSP surface treatment signiﬁcantly\nimproves the fretting fatigue lives of the fretting specimens, and the fretting fatigue life increases\nmost when the laser power density is 4.8 GW /cm2. It is also found that with the increase of the laser\npower density, the fatigue crack initiation location tends to move from the surface to the interior of\nthe specimen.\nKeywords: fretting fatigue; laser shock peening; laser power density; TC11 alloy\n1. Introduction\nFretting is usually recognized as a kind of near-surface damage arising from the relative slip\nbetween the two mating components that are clamped together with a normal force [ 1]. If the relative\nslip of contact surfaces is caused by the cyclical stress load of one of the contact components, then\nthe crack may nucleate and continue to propagate to fatigue failure, which is called fretting fatigue.\nFretting is a problem in many aerospace applications such as airframe lap joints and the dovetail\nattachment between the engine blade and disk [ 2]. In fact, fretting or fretting fatigue has been identiﬁed\nas one of the costliest sources of in-service damage in the US Air Force [ 3]. Considering that the original\ndesign conﬁguration of many components is di ﬃcult to change, the research on surface protection\ntechniques of fretting fatigue has been developed since the 1960s, and some techniques have been\napplied successfully [ 4]. The principle of most surface protection techniques, such as coating and\nshot peening, is to introduce residual compressive stress into the contact surface, reduce the friction\ncoeﬃcient of the contact surface, and improve the hardness and wear resistance of the contact\nsurface [ 5–10]. As an advanced surface treatment, laser shock peening (LSP) which induces the deep\ncompressive residual stresses beneath the contact surfaces has been proved to be signiﬁcantly beneﬁcial\nto improve the fretting fatigue lives [ 11].\nThe simple process of LSP is shown schematically in Figure 1. The region to be treated is covered\nby an absorbing layer, over which is the conﬁnement layer which is usually used as running water [ 12].\nA high-energy laser pulse is directed on to the surface, which passes through the conﬁnement layer\nand is absorbed by the absorbing layer which is usually used as a black coating, metal sacriﬁce layer or\nblack tape [ 13–15]. Then, the plasma is formed over the absorbing surface. The expansion of the plasma\nis constrained by the running water, which drives a shockwave into the material, and this shockwave\ncauses the plastic deformation and residual stresses near surface region.

Therefore, this study was conducted to improve\nthe mechanical properties of the AC4CH alloy, an alternative to cast iron for engine fabrication,\nthrough the addition of Si and Mg to aluminum. The mechanical properties of the alloy were\nimproved through reﬁnement of the Si structure, grain reﬁnement, and heat treatment. In addition,\nthe applicability of a cylinder block fabricated with the modiﬁed AC4CH alloy to a diesel engine was\nvalidated through a 300 h durability test.\nKeywords: AC4CH; weight reduction; diesel engine; reﬁnement\n1. Introduction\nAs the regulations for CO 2emissions have been gradually strengthened to cope with\nglobal warming, many studies have been conducted to improve the efﬁciency of automo-\nbiles [ 1]. Numerous technologies have been developed to reduce CO 2emissions, among\nwhich weight reduction has emerged as an important technical task; thus, many studies\nhave focused on a variety of ways to reduce the weights of automobiles. The engine is one\nof the heaviest parts of an automobile. Generally, the weight of the engine for passenger\ncars is approximately 150–350 kg, and accounts for more than 10% of the total automobile\nweight depending on displacement. This means that if the car weight can be reduced by\nusing a light engine material, CO 2emission reductions as well as fuel efﬁciency can also\nbe improved. Because diesel engines basically use a compression ignition mode, their\ncompression ratios and explosive powers are high compared to engines that use the ﬂame\nignition mode. To withstand such explosive power, the cylinder block of a diesel engine\nis often fabricated using cast iron, which has excellent mechanical properties. However,\ncast iron is heavy, impairing the fuel efﬁciency and mobility of the cars [ 2]. In general, diesel\nengines have a high compression ratio, as the pressure in the combustion chamber increases\nup to 20 MPa during combustion. Therefore, the stiffness and mechanical properties of\nnew engine materials need to be considered. In order to replace the existing iron cylinder\nblock, a steel sleeve is inserted into an aluminum block to secure rigidity and a lightweight\nengine is b"

Diffusion couples have been fabricated using the established Cantor allo y \n(CrMnFeCoNi) and a commercial fcc CoNiCrMo alloy (MP35N®) with constituent or foreign elements as \ndiffusion partners. Chemical gradients within the interdiffusion zone as well as th e phase stability are \nquantified using EDX and EBSD. For comparability of the results, new phase stability d iagrams are \npresented. The experimental results show no general correlation between maximum solubi lity of \nindividual elements and atomic size mismatch, whereas the valence electron concentration  model \n(VEC) seems to be a good approximation for fcc to bcc phase transitions for mos t of the investigated \ndiffusion couples. \nKeywords:  High Entropy Alloy; Diffusion Couple; Phase Stability \n  ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nPage 3:\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n2 \n Introduction:  \nOver the last decade, the attention to a novel class of alloys called high-entropy alloys (HEA) has \nincreased significantly. By definition, these alloys contain at least five princip al elements, each with a \nconcentration of minimum 5 to maximum 35 atomic percent (at%). [1-3]  Furthermore, a single-phase \nsolid solution is often considered as another mandatory criterion. The high-ent ropy alloys with five \nprincipal elements offer a huge parameter space for numerous alloys with poten tially interesting \nproperties. [4] Various alloys have already been developed and characterised from this vast \ncompositional range, yet, it remains widely unexplored . [4, 5]. So far, mainly equiatomic systems have \nbeen investigated in literature, which was driven by the idea of entropy m aximisation [1, 6] . One of \nthese alloys is the prototypical equiatomic and nowadays well known CrMnFeCoNi  alloy, which was \nfirst studied by Cantor et al. [7] and shows a single face-centered cubic (fcc) solid sol ution. Recent \nstudies [8-11] on the thermal stability of the Cantor alloy have revealed the formation of precipitates \nat temperatures below 8 00 °C. Thus, even the Cantor alloy does not fulfil the single-phase cr"

In this frame, a thermal model for\nlaser heating in the form of non-penetrative bead-on-plate welds of aluminum alloy 2024 is proposed\nin this paper. A super-Gaussian proﬁle is considered for the transverse optical intensity and a number\nof laws for temperature-dependent material properties have been included aiming to improve the\nreliability of the model. The output of the simulation in terms of both thermal evolution of the\nparent metal and geometry of the fusion zone is validated in comparison with the actual response:\nnamely, a two-color pyrometer is used to infer the thermal history on the exposed surface around\nthe scanning path, whereas the shape and size of the fusion zone are assessed in the transverse\ncross-section. With an average error of 3% and 4%, the model is capable of predicting the peak\ntemperature and the depth of the fusion zone upon laser heating, respectively. The model is intended\nto offer a comprehensive description of phenomena in laser heating in preparation for a further model\nfor repairing via additive manufacturing.\nKeywords: modeling; laser processing; simulation; pyrometer; aluminum\n1. Introduction\nSimulation tools are crucial in a competitive environment to prevent a trial-and-error approach\nto set the optimum processing conditions at a pre-design stage [ 1]. Moreover, proper modeling\nof an industrial process is the key to introduce closed-loop real-time monitoring where signals are\nmanaged for the purpose of control [ 2], to correct possible deviations of the main factors with respect\nto the intended, simulated response. Therefore, two issues must be addressed: the building of a reliable\nmodel structure and the arranging of effective equipment for real-time monitoring.\nRegarding the former, the need for developing simulation to ols to predict the transient temperature\nfields in laser-based processes has been widely presented i n the literature [ 3]. Indeed, irrespective of\nthe application and the technology, it has been shown that te mperature directly affects the mechanical\nproperties of the final component.\nSome effort has been made in this ﬁeld and a wide range of applications are reported in the\nliterature, including but not limited to hardening [ 4], laser ablation [ 5], laser cutting [ 6], laser drilling [ 7],\nlaser welding [ 8,9], and additive manufacturing of metal powder [ 10,11]. Irrespective of the application,\nthe prediction of the temperature ﬁeld is crucial for many purposes, including but not limited to\nnon-destructive real-time evaluation of the process [ 2], minimization of residual stresses, and heat\naccumulation during additive manufacturing [ 11,12]. In general, advanced complex models are\nrequired to consider beam attenuation in the laser-induced plasma plume when higher irradiance is\nMaterials 2018 ,11, 1506; doi:10.3390/ma110"

This study uses quasi –static in–situand dynamic\nex–situneutron diffraction techniques to follow the evolution of bulk texture, twin volume fraction, and active\ntwinning modes under various strain rates. It is demonstrated that the mechanical responses are strongly rate\nsensitive. The observation is attributed to the variation in slip activity. A distinct twinning mode ch ange during\ncompression is captured through in–situneutron diffraction, and the shear induced reorientation is well de-\nscribed.

The four ingots were extruded into bar materials through a hot-extrusion\nprocess under different temperatures with different extrusion ratios, the mechanical performances\nand the corrosion behaviors in the simulated body ﬂuid (SBF) of the four alloys were investigated,\nand the mechanism of fracture and corrosion was characterized by scanning electron microscopy\n(SEM). The results showed the ultimate compressive strength (UCS) of all the alloys were found\nto be around 360 MPa, while ultimate tensile strengths (UTS) of ZKJ300 (334.61 ±2.92 MPa) and\nZKXQ3000 (337.56 ±2.19 MPa) alloys were much higher than those of ZX30 (298.17 ±0.93 MPa) and\nZK30 (293.26 ±2.71 MPa) alloys. The electrochemical noise and immersion tests in the SBF indicated\nthat ZK30 alloy performed better in corrosion resistance.\nKeywords: biomedical magnesium alloys; microstructure; mechanical properties; corrosion resistance\n1. Introduction\nMagnesium (Mg) alloy has become a typical and new representative material of degradable\nimplants, because of its comprehensive mechanical properties matched with natural bone and excellent\nbiodegradation characteristics [ 1,2], and it has a great marketing prospect and is widely used in\ndegradable medical devices. However, its fast degradation rate, causing the great reduction of the\nmechanical properties and stability of implant materials, and resulting in the failure of materials [ 3,4],\nhas restricted its clinical application in fracture ﬁxation. Meanwhile, a large number of bubbles\nproduced by degradation can signiﬁcantly affect the physiological functions of the surrounding tissues\nand the restoration of the implanted sites [ 5,6]. Moreover, the fast degradation rate leads to the\nincrement of pH value of the body ﬂuid near the implants, which is potentially harmful to human\nbone and tissue growth [ 7]. Therefore, it is very important to control the degradation properties of\nmagnesium alloys to ensure their mechanical integrity and match the tissue growth rate.\nThere have been many methods for improving the properties of magnesium alloys, including\nhigh puriﬁcation of magnesium and its alloys, alloying, improvement of the preparation process,\ndeformation processing, heat treatment and so forth. Alloying is one of the simplest and effective\nmethods used for enhancing the properties of ma"

Two different orientations of\nthe specimens were considered to analyze the loading direction inﬂuence on the material mechanical\nproperties. Moreover, two sets of specimens, as-built (without heat treatment) and after heat treatment,\nwere used. An optical measurement system was also adopted for determining deformation of the\nspecimen, areas of minimum and the maximum principal strain, and an effective plastic strain\nvalue at failure. The loading direction dependence on the material properties was observed with a\nsigniﬁcant inﬂuence of the orientation on the stress and strain level. Microstructure characterization\nwas examined with the use of optical and scanning electron microscopes (SEM); in addition, the\nelectron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) was also used. The fracture mechanism was discussed based\non the fractography analysis. The presented comprehensive methodology proved to be effective and\nit could be implemented for different materials in additive technologies. The material data was used\nto obtain parameters for the selected constitutive model to simulate the energy absorbing structures\nmanufactured with LENS technology. Therefore, a brief discussion related to numerical modelling\nof the LENS Ti-6Al-4V alloy was also included in the paper. The numerical modelling conﬁrmed\nthe correctness of the acquired material data resulting in a reasonable reproduction of the material\nbehavior during the cellular structure deformation process.\nKeywords: additive manufacturing; Ti-6Al-4V; LENS; mechanical characterization\n1. Introduction\nAdditive manufacturing (AM) is currently the fastest growing manufacturing method. It allows\nfor the obtainment of products with a complex geometry and a high dimensional accuracy, as well\nas with high strength parameters [ 1]. The applied technology depends mainly on the batch material\nused. Products made of polymeric materials are obtained with such techniques as fused deposition\nmodeling (FDM), where the material is a thermoplast in a circular wire; stereolitography (SLA), where\nthe material is a light-cured resin; and selective laser sintering (SLS), where the batch material is a\npowdered polymer [ 2,3]. For metal alloys, techniques including powder bed fusion (PBF), selective\nlaser melting (SLM), electron beam melting (EBM) and direct energy deposition (DED), for instance,\nlaser engineered net shaping (LENS) [ 4–7] are used.\nThe tested specimens"

The results indicated that the\nmicrostructure and mechanical properties of the as-bonded alloy were highly dependent on the\nbrazing time (15–45 min), mainly due to the precipitation and distribution characteristics of M 3B2\nboride particles. Speciﬁcally, alloy brazed for 30 min exhibited desirable mechanical properties,\nsuch as a high tensile ultimate strength of 971 MPa and an elongation at fracture of 6.5% at room\ntemperature, exceeding the balance value (935 MPa) of the base metal. The excellent strength and\nplasticity were mainly due to coherent strengthening and dispersion strengthening of the in situ\nspherical and equiaxed M 3B2boride particles in the γ+γ′matrix. In addition, the disappearance of\ndendrites and the homogenization of the microstructure are other factors that cannot be excluded.\nThis powder metallurgy technique, which can avoid the eutectic transformation of traditional brazing,\nprovides a new e ﬀective method for wide-gap repair of alloy materials.\nKeywords: K417G alloy; wide-gap brazed region; M 3B2borides; tensile strength\n1. Introduction\nK417G Ni-based superalloy is widely used in the manufacture of aerospace components, such as\nturbine nozzle guide vanes, integral wheels, and turbine blades, due to its high structural stability and\nexcellent mechanical properties at high temperatures [ 1–3]. However, these aerospace components are\noften exposed to high-temperature and high-pressure environments, which may cause microcracks\nand reduce their service life [ 4]. In recent years, this issue has been addressed using transient liquid\nphase (TLP) bonding [ 5], which is an excellent brazing technique with a ﬁller metal based on eutectic\ntransformations. Since this technique is more e ﬃcient and cost-eﬀective compared to other repair\ntechniques, it has been used for bonding aerospace components and repairing cracks [ 6–8]. However,\ndue to the complete melting of the ﬁller metal and the formation of a brittle eutectic structure, it is\nlimited to gaps smaller than 1.5 mm [ 9–11].\nWith the rapid development of current technology, the maintenance of turbine blades is becoming\nmore and more rigorous [ 12]. As a result, relatively large cracks or worn areas ( >1.5 mm) are discovered\nin aerospace components, where the narrow gap TLP bonding technique would be inadequate [ 13].\nFor wide-gap brazing, the selection and design of the ﬁller metal composition is the key factor to\nimprove the brazing performance [ 14–19]. Considerable e ﬀort has been devoted to adding a second\ngap-ﬁller powder, (hereafter termed additive powder) of similar composition to that of the base metal\n(BM), to the joint gap, for use with braze powder during the h"

Yet, Mg is soft. Long-period stacking ordered (LPSO) structures in Mg alloys \nhave unique crystal structures, characterized by both complex chemical and stacking order. They are \nessential for strengthening of Mg alloys. The formation mechanism of these LPSO structures is still \nunder discussion. Here we report that Y/Zn enriched Guinier-Preston (GP) zones observed in a lean Mg-\nY-Zn model alloy are precursors of early stage LPSO structures. We provide evidence of a new type of \nphase transformation mechanism which comprises the diffusional formation of Y/Zn enriched GP zones \nand their subsequent shear transformation into LPSO building blocks. The mechanism constitutes a \nnew type of coupled diffusional-displacive phase formation sequence which may also be applicable to \nother alloy systems.\nMg and Mg based alloys are key materials for future lightweight applications due to their low mass densit y1. The \nmain drawbacks of Mg and most commercial Mg alloys are intrinsic brittleness and low strength. Complex chem -\nical and structural ordered zones referred to as long-period-stacking-ordered (LPSO) phases2–4 have enabled \nconsiderable strengthening of Mg alloys together with decent ductility compared to con ventional Mg alloys5–7. \nGenerally, LPSO structures are formed in Mg-transition metal-rare earth based systems, with the Mg-Y-Zn sys -\ntem being the most extensively studied one. LPSO structures  have the same {0001} basal plane as Mg while \ntheir stacking periodicity is modified along the c-axis compared to that of Mg. LPSO pha ses include polytypes \nexpressed as 10H, 14H, 18R and 24R2, 4, 8. Here, the integer indicates the number of atomic layers in one period \nand the letters H and R stand for hexagonal and rhombohedral symmetry, respectively9. LPSO structures consist \nof Y/Zn enriched building blocks that have a local fcc stacking sequence on the close packed planes10. The local \nfcc stacking sequence of the LPSO building blocks is due to the existence of bounding Shockley partial dislo -\ncations at each end of the building blocks. The formation of Zn6Y8 clusters of L12 type has been often observed \nmainly in the building blocks of highly alloyed Mg-Y-Zn systems2, 11, 12. Hence, LPSO structures are both chemi -\ncally and stacking ordered. Here we report that Y/Zn enriched GP zones observed in a lean Mg-Y-Zn model alloy \nare precursors of early stage LPSO structures.\nGuinier-Preston (GP) zones, named after the first observations by Guinier13 and Preston14, have enabled \nstrengthening of aerospace alloys such as Al and Ti. Contrary to LPSO structures exhibiting both chemical and \nstacking order, Guinier-Preston (GP) zones only exhibit chemical ordering, maintaining the crystal structure  \nof metallic alloys. During the past decades, extensive research has focused on the structural-chemical ev olution \nand resulting strengthening mechanisms of GP zones in Al alloys using X-ray diffraction and electron micros -\ncopy15–21. Two kinds of GP zones, GP (1) zones and GP (2) zones, have been reported in Al-Cu alloys20, 21. Single \nCu-rich layers are called GP (1) zones whereas GP (2) zones sho w two Cu-rich layers separated by three Al lay -\ners21. GP zones are metastable phases which f"

The morphology of the initial\n7075 aluminum alloy powders was characterized by a Zeiss Evo 50 Scanning electron microscope\n(SEM). Energy Dispersive x-ray (EDX)spectrometer attached to SEM was used as a tool to obtain the\nchemical composition of the powders. Processing parameters including scan speed, hatch distance\nand constant laser power (100 and 150 W )effect on densi ﬁcation, microstructure and hardness were\ninvestigated. The initial powder particles were found to be elongated and non-spherical and composed\nof Al, Zn, Mg, Cu, and Ag without Si. The result of the in ﬂuence of processing parameters on\nproperties of the as-built samples by SLM technology indicates that higher densi ﬁcation of parts can\nbe gained using higher laser power and lower laser scan speed and hatch distance due to signi ﬁcant\nreduction in the number of pores. Two major types of pores including metallurgical and keyhole pores\nhave been identi ﬁed with the keyhole pores dominating the samples processed by low laser power of\n100 W. The keyhole pores increase in size at a high scan speed and hatch distances. By using higher\nlaser power of 150 W, the keyhole pores reduced signi ﬁcantly while metallurgical pores appear. The\nresult of the hardness test conducted on the samples shows that high values of hardness can be\nachieved with low scan speed.\n1. Introduction\nAluminum possesses striking properties that make it an extremely important engineering material. Some of\nthese properties include high electrical and thermal conductivity and high re ﬂectivity [1,2]. Aluminum owes\nhigh corrosion resistance because of the tenacious oxide ﬁlm(Al2O3)which occurs naturally on its surface [3–5].\nDue to high re ﬂectivity and thermal conductivity, aluminum requires high laser power to melt [6,7]. The 7075\naluminum alloy is an alloy of the 7xxx series with combined properties of high thermal conductivity, high\nstrength and good mechanical properties [8,9]. The 7xxx series alloys have high strength because they can be\nhardened by precipitation [1]. The 7075 alloys are built on a quaternary Al –Zn–Mg–Cu alloying system with\nhigh strength and seen as good airframe material [10,11]. They are largely used for structures in modern aircraft\nwhere the speci ﬁc strength of a high level is required [12,13].\nAdditive Manufacturing (AM)techniques are used by most industries today to manufacture com"

This research focused on investigating the effects of Ti additi on on the age hardening response \nof Al 7xxx alloy for Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) turbine impell er application in power plant generators. \nAl-10Zn-6Mg wt. % alloys were produced by squeeze casting with 0.02, 0.05, and 0.25 wt. % Ti addition. \nAs-cast samples were homogenized at 400 oC for 4 h. Solution treatment was conducted at 440 oC for 1 h, \nfollowed by quenching and ageing at 130 oC for 200 h. Age hardening result was observed using Rockwell \nB hardness measurement. Other characterizations included impact  testing, STA, optical microscopy, and \nSEM-EDS. Results showed that the addition of Ti in all content variations i ncreased the as-cast hardness \ndue to the diminution of seconda ry dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) values of the alloy. Ageing at 130 oC \nstrengthened the alloys, however  the addition of Ti was not found to affect neither peak hardness nor impact \nvalues of the alloy. Identities o f second phases formed during solidification were found to be T \n(Mg 32(Al,Zn) 49), β (Al 8Mg 5), and TiAl 3, while precipitates produce d during ageing were GP Zone, η’, and η \n(MgZn 2). Keywords – ageing, Al-Zn-Mg, grain refining, MgZn 2, Ti addition. \n1 Introduction  \nAl 7xxx alloys with its Zn and Mg alloying content are \ncommonly used for high temperature service. The alloy \nis currently developed for turbine impeller application in \nnovel Organic Rankine Cycle/ORC power generating \nsystem considering its lightweight, strong, and durable \nproperties [1] that would contribute positively to the \noverall system efficiency.  \nGrain refining agents – e.g. Ti, Cr, Zr, or other rare \nearth elements are used in order to further strengthen the \nalloy. Kurniawan [2] founded that 0.067, 0.081, and \n0.115 wt. % Ti content in AC4B alloy all resulted in  \nincreased strength and UTS value of the alloy. Addition \nof 0.050 and 0.072 wt. % Ti was also evident to be able \nto optimize the hardness of AC4B alloy by 2.80 % and \n7.17 %, along with optimizing its tensile strength by \n4.40 % and 5.10 % compared to those without Ti \naddition. The strengthening mechanism was a result of \nprimary α-Al grain refining phenomenon followed by a \ndecrease in dendrite arm spacing/DAS value [3]. \nHeterogeneous nucleation and grain boundary \nstrengthening effect were also found after 0.058, 0. 073, \nand 0.104 wt. % Ti addition to both squeeze-cast and \naged Al-9Zn-6Mg-2Si wt. % alloy with ZrO 2 \nreinforcement [4].  \nSigworth and Kuhn [5] showed that Ti contributed to \nthe grain refining mechanism by rising Al solidific ation \ntemperature from 660.1 to 665 oC, at which TiAl 3 \nparticles formed and initiated the cooling of Al melt to \nprimary α-Al phase. TiAl 3 particles induced a heterogeneous nucleation of α-Al, hence a greater \nnumber of present TiAl 3 would refine the overall grain \nsize. A research by Gao, et. al. [6] displayed an \nagreement to the statement, in which the addition of 0.2 \nwt. % Ti to Al-6"

The precipitation\nbehavior was investigated before and after the addition of boron in different S31254 alloys during the\ncompression deformation, and the nose temperature at 950◦C and the phase dissolution temperature\nat 1074◦C were selected as the measurement temperature. The result showed that more σphases were\nprecipitated at the grain boundary of S31254 alloys, compared to the boron-added alloy. Meanwhile,\nthe addition of 40 ppm boron into the alloys has obviously prevented the σphases from the austenitic\nmatrix, and it takes longer time for the precipitation of σphase at 950◦C. The speciﬁc inﬂuence\nfactors of boron on the precipitation of σphases were also further discussed.\nKeywords: σphase; super austenitic stainless steel; precipitation me chanism; compression deformation;\nboron\n1. Introduction\nS31254 steel with high content of Cr, Ni, Mo and N, known as a kind of super austenite\nstainless steel, is widely used in seawater treatment systems, chemical processing equipment, ﬂue gas\ndesulfurization systems, incinerators, and the nuclear industries, due to its excellent corrosion\nresistance [ 1–3]. Generally, the S31254 has a face centered cubic (FCC) structure [ 4–7]. Moreover,\ndue to its high Mo and Cr content, brittle harmful precipitates such as carbide, χandσphases,\ncan be easily formed [ 8–11], leading to the deterioration of the corrosion resistance and mechanical\nproperties. The solution and precipitation of second phases are often relative to the local composition,\nheat treatment time and temperature [ 12–19]. As temperature changes from 700◦C to 1100◦C, carbides\ncan easily form. Also, these carbides are usually replaced by intermetallic compounds at longer aging\ntimes, such as σ,χand Laves phases. Low carbon solubility can lead to the formation of σphase, while\na high solubility of interstitial elements in the austenite matrix favors the precipitation of χand Laves\nphases. The increased Mo content is helpful for the precipitation of intermetallic compounds at higher\ntemperatures. Therefore, it is very important to avoid the existence of a brittle phase.\nAs an efﬁcient method, the segregation of B atoms at the austenite grain boundary can lower\nthe grain boundary energy, and inhibit the nucleation of second phase. The positive effects can be\nobtained only by a very small amount of B, within the order of ppm, providing signiﬁcant impacts\non the production process of steels [ 20].

Electron beam welding (EBW) was used to join the Ti55 alloy\npowder compact and effects of annealing treatment on the microstructure and mechanical\nproperties of EBW joints were investigated. The residual stress distribution of as-welded\njoint was calculated using ﬁnite element method (FEM). The results show that the micro-\nstructure and microhardness proﬁles are non-uniform across the EBW joints. The tensile\nresidual stresses are conﬁrmed across the as-welded joints based on FEM analysis. All of\ntensile specimens failed at the base metal, indicating that the mechanical properties of\nEBW joints are equal to those of base metal, or better. The tensile strength of as-welded\nand as-annealed joints increases slightly compared with base metal. An obvious reduc-\ntion on the reduction of area of EBW joints was obtained after annealing at 500/C14C. Related\nmechanisms were discussed based on the residual stress, tensile deformation and the\nstrain rate sensitivity.\n©2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\nThe development of superalloys has been driven by the\ndemand to increase the operating temperatures of gas tur-\nbines in power plants and aircraft engines. Among various\nclasses of superalloys, including Fe-base, Co-base and Ni-base superalloys, Ni-base superalloys strengthened withthe L1\n2compound ( c0phase) possess the highest heat resis-\ntance. For the highest-temperature applications, they aresolidiﬁed into a single-crystal form, and alloyed to achievea high volume fraction of the c\n0precipitates, good solid-\nsolution strengthening of the candc0phases along with\nenvironmental resistance. The superior strength of c/c0\nNi-base superalloys at elevated temperature can be attrib-\nuted to a high volume fraction of regularly aligned coher-entc\n0precipitates with a cuboidal shape that inhibit the\ndislocation glide in the cchannels [1,2]. In the mostadvanced Ni-base single-crystal superalloys, the volume\nfraction of the c0phase reaches approximately 70%.\nRecently, a stable ternary Co 3(Al,W) phase with L1 2\nstructure was discovered by Sato et al. [3]. The c0-Co 3\n(Al,W) phase thermodynamically equilibrates with c-Co\n(fcc) solid-solution phase in the Co–Al–W ternary alloysystem at 1173 K. In addition, the small misﬁt betweenthecandc\n0phases permits the formation of a coherent\ntwo-phase microstructure where submicron cuboidal c0\nprecipitates align regularly in a continuous matrix phase.\nThis is morphologically identical to the microstructure ofc/c\n0two-phase Ni-base superalloys. Conventional Co-base\nsuperalloys lack eﬀective precipitation strengthening by\nintermetallic compounds, and depend on solid-solution ele-ments and precipitation of low volume fraction of carbidesfor their strength. Despite their inferior strength comparedto the Ni-base superalloys, Co-base superalloys generallyoﬀer better oxidation, corrosion and wear resistance, andhave therefore been utilized in components where environ-mental resistance is required, such as gas turbine vanes,\n1359-6454/$34.00 /C2112007 Acta Materialia Inc.

Behaviors showing significant twinning during \ninitial in-plane compression and untwinning in subsequent tension at and slightly above \nroom temperature were recorded. Strong yielding asymmetry and nonlinear hardening \nbehavior were also revealed. Considerable Bauschinger effects, transient behavior, and \nvariable permanent softening responses were observed near room temperature, but these \nwere reduced and almost disappeared as the temperature increased. Different stress –strain \nresponses were inherent to the activation of twinning at lower temperatures and non-basal \nslip systems at elevated temperatures. A critical temperature was identified to account for \nthe transition between the twinning-dominant and slip-dominant deformation mechanisms. \nAccordingly, below the transition point, stress –strain curves of cyclic loading tests \nexhibited concave-up shapes for compression or compression following tension, and an OPEN ACCESS  \nPage 2:\nMaterials 2014 , 7 1272 \n \nunusual S-shape for tension following compression. This unusual shape disappeared when \nthe temperature was above the transition point. Shrinkage of the elastic range and variation \nin Young’s  modulus due to plastic strain deformation during stress reversals were also \nobserved. The texture-induced anisotropy of both the elastic and plastic behaviors was \ncharacterized experimentally. \nKeywords:  yielding asymmetry; anisotropy; hardening; tension/compression loading; \nYoung’s  modulus \n \n1. Introduction \nLightweight materials have become increasingly important for the automotive industry with the \nincrease in fuel prices, legislative requirements, and directives for controlling carbon dioxide (CO 2) \nemissions. Interest in making cars lighter and more fuel-efficient has encouraged the automotive \nindustry to replace steel, iron, and in some cases,  aluminum parts, with magnesium (Mg) alloys due to \ntheir unique combination of being lightweight, having high specific strength and stiffness, and being \nhighly recyclable. In addition, Mg alloys have been used for computer, communication, and consumer \nelectronic applications due to their good "

Some combinations, e.g.,\nsteel to aluminum, simply provide undulating waves, while others, e.g., titanium to copper, provide\nelegant vortices. These physical features can affect the strength of the joint produced, and thus a\nmore comprehensive understanding of the material combination effects during MPW is required.\nTo investigate the interfacial morphology and parent material properties dependency during MPW,\ntubular Al1100 and various copper alloy joints were fabricated. The inﬂuence of two material\nproperties, i.e., yield strength and density, were studied, and the interface morphology features were\nvisually investigated. Results showed that both material properties affected the interface morphology.\nExplicitly, decreasing yield strength (Cu101 and Cu110) led to a wavy interface, and decreasing\ndensity (Cu110 and CP-Ti) resulted in a wave interface with a larger wavelength. Numerical analyses\nwere also conducted in LS-DYNA and validated the interface morphologies observed experimentally.\nThese simulations show that the effect on shear stresses in the material is the cause of the interface\nmorphology variations obtained. The results from this research provide a better fundamental\nunderstanding of MPW phenomena with respect to the effect of material properties and thus how to\ndesign an effective MPW application.\nKeywords: magnetic pulse welding; material properties; interface morphology; numerical analysis\n1. Introduction\nElectromagnetic forming (EMF) process has been known and applied for several\ndecades [ 1]. In the EMF process, a large amount of energy on the order of tens of kilojoules\nis charged to a capacitor bank and then dissipates to a designed coil in the form of sinusoid\ndamped current trace. A magnetic ﬁeld is generated around the coil, and eddy currents\nare induced in the nearby conductive workpiece. Thus, the repulsive Lorentz forces are\ngenerated between the coil and workpiece, which is driven away and reaches a velocity of\nhundred meters per second in less than 1 ms. Due to the dynamic nature of this process,\nthe workpiece formability can be improved. The other beneﬁts of EMF include reduced\nmaterial wrinkling and springback, high re"

Whittaker\nReceived: 11 January 2017; Accepted: 8 February 2017; Published: 10 February 2017\nAbstract: Controlling grain size in polycrystalline nickel base superalloy is vital for obtaining required\nmechanical properties. Typically, a uniform and ﬁne grain size is required throughout forging\nprocess to realize the superplastic deformation. Strain amount occupied a dominant position in\nmanipulating the dynamic recrystallization (DRX) process and regulating the grain size of the alloy\nduring hot forging. In this article, the high-throughput double cone specimen was introduced to\nyield wide-range strain in a single sample. Continuous variations of effective strain ranging from 0.23\nto 1.65 across the whole sample were achieved after reaching a height reduction of 70%. Grain size is\nmeasured to be decreased from the edge to the center of specim en with increase of effective strain.\nSmall misorientation tended to generate near the grain boun daries, which was manifested as piled-up\ndislocation in micromechanics. After the dislocation dens ity reached a critical value, DRX progress\nwould be initiated at higher deformation region, leading to the refinement of grain size. During this\nprocess, the transformations from low angle grain boundari es (LAGBs) to high angle grain boundaries\n(HAGBs) and from subgrains to DRX grains are found to occur. A fter the accomplishment of DRX\nprogress, the neonatal grains are presented as having simil ar orientation inside the grain boundary.\nKeywords: nickel base superalloy; hot deformation; high-throughput experimental method; double\ncone; misorientation; grain size\n1. Introduction\nPowder metallurgy nickel base superalloys have been extensively applied in rotating parts\nof aero turbine engines due to their exceptional mechanical properties and trustworthy corrosion\nresistance at elevated temperatures [ 1–3]. The superb mechanical performance is closely related to\ngrain size and precipitate size/distribution/volume fraction. Generally, the in-service components\nwith uniform and ﬁne grains are required and fabricated via a series of processes including powder\natomization, hot isostatic pressing, hot extrusion, and isothermal forging. To realize near-net-shaping\nof the industry-scale product, the capability of superplastic deformation is required and the grain size\nneeds to be carefully controlled throughout hot forging. Previous results [ 4–6] showed that dynamic\nrecrystallization (DRX) occupied the dominant position in reﬁning the grain size and promoted\nsuperplastic forming. The DRX process was documented as being closely related to temperature [ 7]\nand strain rate [ 8,9], and was usually initiated when the strain reached a critical value [ 10–12].\nMaterials 2017 ,10, 161; doi:10.3390/ma10020161 www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nPage 2:\nMaterials 2017 ,10, 161 2 of 14\nTo date, previous "

In this study, in ord er to develop a detailed \nmap of cracks and understand the root cause of cracking, a comprehensive microstructural and \nnumerical analysis was performed. The elemental mapping in scanning electron microscope  \n(SEM) -energy dispersive spectral analysis revealed  segregation of alloying elements in the \ncracked area of FZ and HAZ. In other words, o ne of the cracking mechanisms in FZ and HAZ \nwas found to be segregation induced liquation and subsequent cracking due to thermal and \nmechanical tensile stresses generated  during EBW. Cracking in FZ also occurred because of low \nstrength of the solidifying weld metal as well as solidification contraction. As well, γ’ dissolution \nand reprecipitation  in HAZ leading to decreased ductility and generation of contraction stresses \nwas another mechanism for cracking in HAZ. The numerical model was capable to predict the \ncracking location as well as cracking orientation with respect to the weld line.  \nKey Wo rds: Electron beam welding ; Inconel -713LC ; cracking ; segregation induced liquation ; \ncontraction ; numerical modeling  \n \n                                                           \nCorresponding author: e -mail: achamanfar@ gmail. com, Phone: +1 514 396 8800 ext. 7868,  \nFax: +1 514 396 8530  \nPage 3:\n2 \n 1.

Using electron microscopy and atom probe tomography we observed\ntwo distinct heat a ﬀect zones, namely γislands containing γ′precipitate ( ∼45 nm in size) colonies and heat\naﬀected γ/γ′regions outside the γislands comprising ﬁneγ′precipitates ( ∼25 nm in size). Based on the ex-\nperimental data and thermodynamic calculations, we propose a model for the formation of these two heataﬀected zones and discuss the di ﬀerences in the observed precipitate sizes.\n1. Introduction\nRecently, there has been a growing interest in Co-based alloys with\na two-phase γ/γ′microstructure (L1 2ordered γ′precipitates in a dis-\nordered fcc γmatrix) owing to their excellent high-temperature\nstrength and hot corrosion resistance [ 1]. Among the reported Co-based\nsystems, Co –Ti is the only known binary alloy which exhibits a two-\nphase region comprising a thermodynamically stable γ′and γphase\n[2,3]. By adding W to a Co –Ti base alloy, Yoo et al. [ 4] obtained an\nincreased solvus temperature (1144 °C) and a reduced γ/γ’lattice mis ﬁt\n(0.69%), making Co –Ti–W alloys promising for high-temperature ap-\nplications.\nHowever, Co –Ti–W alloys are prone to oxidation and corrosion\nsince they do not contain any protective oxide forming elements such as\nCr or Al. Thus, an oxidation-resistant coating of superior quality is re-\nquired. MCrAlY (M = Co, Ni) overlay coatings deposited by thermal\nspraying are typically used to protect a superalloy from high-tempera-\nture oxidation. However, thermal spraying is reported to lead to in-\nternal oxidation and pore formation, which can deteriorate the per-\nformance of the coating [ 5,6]. Laser cladding, which is based on\npowder deposition and melting using a laser, is an attractive alternativemethod for deposition of MCrAlY coatings [ 7–10]. This method can\nproduce dense layers with strong metallurgical bonding to the substrate[11]. Ansari et al. [ 12] reported outstanding oxidation resistance and\ngood scale adhesion of the IN738 alloy laser cladded with MCrAlY evenat 1100 °C, which was attributed to the superior quality of the MCrAlYcoating.\nHowever, during laser cladding, the high-power laser beam can not\nonly a ﬀect the powder deposit but also the base metal and lead to the\nformation of a heat a ﬀected zone (HAZ) and a partially melted zone\n(PMZ) [ 13]. Microstructural changes in HAZ and PMZ are often detri-\nmental to the high-temperature mechanical properties [ 14,15]. More-\nover, grain boundary liquation and cracking due to a eutectic reaction\nin the HAZ and PMZ was reported for welded Ni-base superalloys [ 16]\nas well as high-Mn steels [ 17].\nNumerous reports exist on the phase formation and stability of γ/γ′-\nstrengthened Co-based superalloys [ 18–22].\n However, to the best of"

Introduction\nA series of nickel (Ni)-base superalloy single crystals has been\ndeveloped recently [1–3]in a new compositional design space\nfor potential turbine blade applications. This alloy series, termedLDS (low density single crystal), was explored in an effort toproduce single crystal alloys with low densities, while concur-\nrently achieving high temperature creep resistance, microstruc-\ntural stability, and excellent oxidation resistance. The Ni-basealloy contained fixed contents of aluminum (Al) and tantalum(Ta) for γ′precipitation, as well as variations in the levels of\nchromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), molybdenum (Mo), and rhenium(Re). Cr was added to the alloy for improved oxidation resistanceand was explored [1–3]at relatively low levels to determine\nminimum Cr concentrations required for sufficient oxidationresistance. Co was chosen as a conventional superalloy addi-\ntion, since its density matches that of Ni, and as a result, doesnot increase alloy density. Co has also been reported to improvealloy stability [4–7]. However, the key alloying strategy employed\nin this work involved replacing some of the strategic and highdensity Re, and all of the high density tungsten (W), with Mo forsolid solution strengthening. Mo is known to be a potent solid\nsolution strengthener, but has a density almost half that of\neither Re or W.\nThe alloys in the present paper represent the compositional\ndesign space described above, which is considered novel becauseof the relatively high Mo content combined with a low Cr levelin single crystal form. Superalloy single crystals with high Mocontents were studied earlier [8–10], but these were"

The precipitates are coherent with the face-centred\ncubic c-Co matrix and possess ordered L1 2structure. The microstructure is identical to the popular c–c’ type nickel-based superalloys and that\nof recently reported Co–Al–W-based alloys.

All rights reserved.\nKeywords: Cobalt-based superalloy; c–c’ microstructure; Solvus temperature; Density; Speciﬁc yield strength\nCentral to the development of nickel-based superal-\nloys for high-temperature applications is the precipitation\nof coherent Ni 3Al intermetallic compound ( c’) having\nordered L1 2structure in the face-centred cubic (fcc) nickel\nmatrix ( c)[1–5]. The precipitates and the low-energy c–c’\ninterface provide high-temperature strength and stability\nto these alloys. In the Co–Al system, the phase Co 3Al does\nnot exist, while in the Co–Ti system, a compound Co 3Ti\nwith ordered L1 2structure ( c’) has been reported. However,\nthis phase is not stable at high temperature (>750 /C176C)[6,7].\nTherefore the report on coherent precipitation of anordered c’ (Co\n3(Al,W)) in cobalt matrix in a ternary alloy\nCo–9.2Al–9 W that is stable at high temperature (990 /C176C)\nby Sato et al. [8]opened up new possibilities for developing\ncobalt-based superalloys with c–c’ structure. Several subse-\nquent reports have dealt with the inﬂuence of additional\nalloying elements on the stability, microstructure and prop-erties of this new class of alloys [9–15] . Study of the\nmechanical properties of these alloys, particularly at higher\ntemperatures, indicates early promise [16–18] . Further, the\ncreep properties are found to be superior to those of exist-\ning cobalt-based alloys and comparable to that reported for\nnickel-based superalloys [19–21] . Recently, the oxidation\nproperties of these “W”-containing alloys have attracted\nincreasing attention [22–26] . These studies have indicated\nthe possibility of the formation of protective oxide coatingsat high temperatures. Hence Co–Al–W-based alloys are\nexceptional in terms of stability and high strength com-\npared to other cobalt-based superalloys.\nThe main drawbacks of the present Co–Al–W-based\nalloys are their high density and relatively poorer ductilitycompared to nickel-based superalloys. Since tungsten is\nthe main alloying addition, the speciﬁc strengths of thesealloys are low and hence not suitable for applications such\nas in aerospace industries where a good strength to weight\nratio is crucial. The densities of tungsten-bearing cobalt-based superalloys vary from 9.3 to 10.5 gm cm\n/C03whereas\nthe nickel-based superalloys have densities in the range of\n7.9–8.5 gm cm/C03[10,27] . In addition, the presence of tung-\nsten makes homogenization of cast Co–Al–W alloys diﬃ-\ncult. Therefore, although promising, Co–Al–W alloys\nhave to overcome severe hurdles to replace nickel-basedsuperalloys even in niche applications.\nThe present work reports a new c–c’ cobalt-based super-\nalloy w"

Especially in the ﬁeld of high\nperformance alloys, like nickel-base superalloys, this opens new opportunities for homogeniza-\ntion and alloy development. Nevertheless, the high susceptibility to cracking of precipita-\ntion-hardenable superalloys is a challenge for AM. In this study, electron beam-based AM is\nused to fabricate samples from gas-atomized pre-alloyed CMSX-4 powder. The inﬂuence of the\nprocessing strategy on crack formation is investigated. The samples are characterized by optical\nand SEM microscopy and analyzed by microprobe analysis. Diﬀerential scanning calorimetry is\nused to demonstrate the eﬀect of the ﬁne microstructure on characteristic temperatures. In\naddition, in situ heat treatment eﬀects are investigated.\nDOI: 10.1007/s11661-015-3300-y\n/C211The Author(s) 2016. This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com\nI. INTRODUCTION\nSINGLE -CRYSTAL nickel-base superalloys are well\nknown for their extraordinary high-temperature prop-\nerties. Thus, these alloys are widely used in the aero-\nspace industry for turbine blades and vanes in the hot\nsection of today’s gas turbine engines.\nCMSX-4 is a second generation single-crystal super-\nalloy containing 3 wt pct Re. This alloy is derived from\nCMSX-2, employing the beneﬁcial strengthening eﬀects\nof Re. It was established in the early 1990s and is used\nfor single-crystalline turbine blades. Single-crystalline\nCMSX-4 is typically fabricated via investment\ncasting and has been extensively developed to enhance\nthe high-temperature properties. In addition, the\nmicrostructure is optimized by special heat treatments.\nAfter the conventional process route, it is not possible to\ndissolve the residual microsegregation in an economic\nway.[1]The alloy provides good high-temperature prop-\nerties due to the two-phase c/c¢-microstructure, a high\nvolume fraction of c¢(up to 70 pct) and the solid\nsolution strengthening eﬀects of Cr, W, Ta, and Re.\nAdditionally, Re decreases signiﬁcantly the c¢coarsening\nkinetics.[2]CMSX-4 also enhances oxidation resistance\ndue to the reduced level of Cr and an increased level of\nAl (Al 2O3former, more stable than Cr 2O3at high\ntemperatures).In the as-cast condition, the microstructure of\nCMSX-4 shows a dendritic pattern with a c/c¢-eutectic\nin between (Figure 1). Segregation is caused by consti-\ntutional undercooling during solidiﬁcation. Typically, c\nstabilizers like the refractory metals W, Co, and Re\nsegregate within dendrite core areas, whereas c¢stabi-\nlizers like Al, Ti, and Ta accumulate within interden-\ndritic areas.[3,4]Thus, the cubic c¢precipitates are smaller\nwithin the dendritic core regions and become coarser\nnear the interdendritic areas (eutectic regions)\n(Figure 1(c)) due to the increased amount of c¢stabiliz-\ners.[5]Due to the inhomogeneous c¢-distribution and\nremaining c/c¢-eutectic, great eﬀorts with respect to\ntime-consuming heat treatments have been undertaken\nto homogenize the microstructure in order to improve\nthe high-temperature properties.\nUsually, speciﬁc heat treatments for c¢-precipitation\nand aging are performed after homogenization to reach\nthe optimal c¢size and cubical morphology.[1,6]\nAn important criterion for heat treatment is t"

The results show that both the\nas-deposited and heat-treated deposits were dominated by the columnar grains with a width of 100\ne270mm. The equiaxed grains mainly originated from the columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET) during\nLSF while a small portion of the equiaxed grains originated from recrystallization during the heattreatment, due to the relatively low temperature gradient in the induction-assisted LSF. Fine grainstrengthening was still working in the columnar-grains dominated LSFed IN-738LC deposits. However,\ng0\nstrengthening was found to play a major role in the strengthening mechanism by comparing themicrostructure and properties of different heat-treated deposits. The\ng0dissolution and coarsening ki-\nnetics were calculated and the interaction mechanism between the dislocation and g0phase in LSFed IN-\n738LC was clari ﬁed. The deformation of the coarse (d >200 nm) near cubic g0was found to be bene ﬁcial\nto the increase of ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation (EL), while a brittle continuous phaseformed at the grain boundary (GB) which was rich in Ni, Cr, Al and Ti was found to be detrimental to the\ndeposit's plasticity. The\ng0phase deformation and desquamating, carbide breaking and GB phase\nbreaking are the predominant fracture failure mechanisms. On the basis of relatively high strength, theIN-738LC deposits with a lower yield strength (YS)/UTS ratio than the cast and SLMed ones were ob-tained when solution-treated at 1070\n/C14C.\n©2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.\n1. Introduction\nAs one of the typical laser-based additive manufacturing tech-\nnologies, laser solid forming (LSF) is characterized by near-netshaping, absence of size restrictions, full-dense structure and high\nperformance [ 1]. Moreover, the relatively low cost of LSF technol-\nogy, when repairing parts with high production and replacement\ncosts is also a signi ﬁcant advantage [ 2]. In recent years, research has\nbeen driven by LSF applications in the fabrication of complex,\nstructural parts with excellent performance when using aluminum\nalloy [ 3], titanium alloy [ 4], steel [ 5] and nickel-based superalloy\n[6e8].\nAs a typical g0-strengthening nickel-base superalloy, IN-738LC is\nstrengthened by precipitating ordered Ni 3(Al,Ti)- g0phase in the g\nmatrix.

The dislocations become visible because of grooves, whichform in the /H9253//H9253\n/prime-interface at the dislocation core. The groove formation mechanism was investigated\nby annealing/cooling experiments and creep experiments with the single-crystal superalloys SRR99 andCMSX-4. Possible forces for groove formation are discussed and their magnitude is estimated. The osmoticforce, resulting from the vacancy supersaturation during quenching, was found to be the main reason forgroove formation. The correlation between groove shape and Burgers vector of the interfacial dislocationis explained. The conditions required for observation of such grooves using SEM are discussed.\n© 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\nNickel base superalloys consist of two phases: the fcc matrix\n(/H9253phase) and L1 2precipitates ( /H9253/primephase). After standard heat\ntreatment the precipitates have a cuboidal shape and the /H9253//H9253/prime-\ninterfaces are planar and coherent. Deformation or overagingat high temperature results in interfacial dislocations formingnetworks. They relax misﬁt stresses and introduce backstresses,retarding mobile matrix dislocations. Therefore the investiga-tion of interfacial dislocations is of immense interest [1–7] .\nWhilst studies have been historically conducted by transmis-sion electron microscopy (TEM), it has recently been shownthat such semicoherent interfaces can also be visualized byscanning electron microscope (SEM) [8]. When the /H9253\n/prime-phase is\nremoved by deep etching, the /H9253//H9253/prime-interface becomes visible,\nand is covered with a net of grooves, formed at the disloca-tions.\nThe aim of our new investigations was to determine the mech-\nanism by which these grooves are formed, allowing both controlover groove formation as well as an understanding of the connec-tion between groove shape and dislocation type. Speciﬁcally, theinvestigation sought to answer the following questions:\n1st question\n: Do the grooves form when the material is cooled\ndown from test temperature or have they formed beforehand, when\n∗Corresponding author.

A groove could form dur-\ning cooling, when the partially dissolved /H9253/prime-phase re-precipitates\nat the /H9253//H9253/primeinterface.

Four-stage heat treatment was performed on the service-exposed alloy. The microstructures of the service-exposed and rejuvenated alloys were examined by optical and scanning electron microscopes. The hardness, tension, and stress-rupture tests were carried out to characterise the mechanical properties. The results showed \nthat the heat treatment could rejuvenate the microstructure of the alloy that was deteriorated \nduring the service at high temperatures. Decomposed MC carbides were transformed to new fine carbides, continuous M23C6 carbides were dissolved and new discontinuous carbides along the grain boundaries were regenerated and, finally, the fine γ׳ particles were reformed. The microstructural recovery resulted in an increase in the hardness and ultimate tensile strength of the alloy. The results also showed that the creep behavior of the alloy at a testing temperature of 850°C could be improved by the heat treatment.\nIntroduction\nNickel base superalloys used in gas turbine blades and \nvanes experience high temperatures and stresses during \nservice. These service conditions could cause various \nmicrostructural changes during the operation period \nincluding coarsening and coalescence of the gamma \nprime particles, the formation of continuous second-\nary M23C6 precipitates on the grain boundaries, pri-\nmary MC degeneration and topologically close-packed \nphase formation [ 1–14]. Degradation of the mechanical \nproperties such as hardness, tensile strength, and creep \nresistance usually occurs because of the time-dependent \nmicrostructural changes. The use of expensive materials \nin gas turbine blades and vanes requires a repair process \nproviding the re-establishment of the initial properties and the original microstructure of the long-term used \nor damaged parts for the ec"

Introduction\nNi-base oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) superalloys are\npromising materials for gas turbine applications due to their excellent\nhigh temperature properties [1–4]. Recent studies have investigated\nthe effect of microstructure on high temperature properties of conven-tional ODS superalloys such as MA6000 and PM 3030 [5–8].T h e y\nachieve high temperature capability especially creep resistance byboth ordered gamma-prime ( γ′) precipitation strengthening at\nintermediate temperatures and oxide dispersion strengthening at hightemperatures. The morphology and distribution of the γ′precipitates\ninside the γmatrix have been found to in ﬂuence the high temperature\nproperties strongly [9]. The development of γ′morphology is governed\nby the interfacial and elastic strain energies [10]. As the volume fraction\nofγ′increases, the elastic strain energy plays a more dominant role over\ninterfacial energy, thus stabilizing the morphology of the precipitates[11]. Ricks et al. have observed that the morphology of γ′often evolves\nfrom spherical to cuboidal shape to arrays of cubes during aging timedue to elastic strains associated with lattice mis ﬁt[12].B e s i d e s ,t h e\ncontrol of oxide dispersion is an effective way to improve the high\ntemperature strengthening through the pinning of moving dislocations.In order to reach a superior pinning effect, it is necessary to reduce theinterparticle spacing through the distribution of ﬁne oxide nanoparti-\ncles[13,14] . Commercially available mechanically alloyed (MAed) ODS\nsuperalloys such as MA6000 consist of different incoherent Y-Al oxide\nparticles including YA1\n209,Y3Al5O12, and YAlO 3[15].

In this study,  the microstructure,  \ntexture  and elastic  anisotropy  of the nickel -based  superalloy,  CM24 7LC,  in the as-SLM  and \nheat -treated  states  have  been  analysed.  The as-SLM  microstructure  showed  fine elongated  \ncells  with  a preferential  alignment  of <001>  along  the build  direction  and a significant  \nintercellular  misorientation.  Heat  treatments  at tempera tures  below  1230  °C resulted  in a \nprogressive  recovery  of the microstructure,  whilst  heat  treatments  above  this temperature  \ngave  rise to a recrystallised  microstructure.  The extent  to which  nucleation  and growth  of \nthe ' precipitates  and secondary  particles  were  affected  by increasing  the heat  treatment  \ntemperature  was also characterised.  The bulk  elastic  anisotropy  of all samples  was \nmeasured  by resonant  ultrasound  spectroscopy  (RUS)  and was found  to be consistent  with  \nthe local  textures  obtained  by electron  ba"

Secondary γ′in deformed regions and in dynamic recrystallization (DRX) regions have di ﬀerent\nevolution behaviors during hot working. In deformed regions precipitates have a noteworthy coarsening ten-\ndency depending on strain rates. At high strain rates, e.g. at 1 s−1,γ′is elongated along strain direction by plastic\ndeformation. Whereas, directional coarsening takes place at low strain rates, e.g. 0.001 s−1, owing to the severe\nplastic deformation and the high concentration level of γ′-forming element induced by supersolvus treatment.\nAnd thus secondary γ′evolution in deformed regions can be attributed to two competing factors: (a) plastic ﬂow\nand (b) directional coarsening induced by di ﬀusion. In contrast, γ′in DRX regions always dissolves following\ngrain boundary migration and almost re-precipitates at boundaries. Only a small number of re-precipitated γ′can\nbe found in the interior of new grains. Abnormal phenomenon of sharp stress decline appears at low strain ratesand low deformation temperatures, which is related to DRX, γ′directional coarsening and γ′dissolution.\n1. Introduction\nPrecipitation strengthened nickel-base superalloys, a typical multi-\nphase alloys endowed with excellent mechanical properties and cor-\nrosion resistances at elevated temperature, have been widely used in\npower generation and aerospace industries [ 1–3]. These alloys have a\nmicrostructure consisting of numerous ordered γ′-Ni3Al precipitates\ncoherently embedded in face-centered cubic γmatrix [ 4]. Among of\nthem, advanced superalloys with more than 40 vol% of γ′are being\ndeveloped and applied for improvements in engine e ﬃciency and ser-\nvice temperature [ 5].\nIn order to obtain excellent comprehensive performances for a\nspeciﬁc application, γ′characteristics, including volume fraction, size\ndistribution and morphology, are usually controlled and optimized by a\nscheduled heat treatment. Beyond that, γ′precipitates are considered\ncrucial as well in determining the hot deformation behavior of super-alloys. Microstructure evolution of superalloys operated at γ+γ′du-\nplex phase ﬁeld is strongly in ﬂuenced by γ′[6,7]. Hot forming opera-\ntions are therefore carefully developed upon the γ′solvus temperature\nto optimize the grain size of γmatrix as well as to attain the targetcomponent shape [ 8]. As such, a considerable amount of investigations\non superalloys hot deformation have been devoted to recrystallization\nmechanisms, γ′evolution in recrystallization regions and interactions\nbetween γ′and recrystallization [ 7,9–11].\nIt is well known that grain boundary migration can be restricted by\nparticles through a pinning pressure referred as Zener drag [ 12,13].

A two-phase microstructure γ/γ ʹwith ultrahigh\nγʹvolume fraction was designed in the Co-Ti-V (master alloy), Co-Ti-V-Al (Al-modi ﬁed) and Co-Ti-V-Ni (Ni-\nmodiﬁed) alloys. Al shows a slight tendency to partition into γʹ, while Ni exhibits almost equal distribution\nbetween the γandγʹphases. Al is found to increase the volume fraction and solvus temperature of γʹ. The solvus\ntemperatures of γʹin the master alloy, Al-modi ﬁed and Ni-modi ﬁed alloys exceed that of Co-9Al-9W alloy\n(1000 °C) by 91, 112 and 82 °C, respectively. The ﬂow stresses of the designed alloys exhibit an anomalous\npositive dependence on temperature rising from 600 to 750 °C. The strengths of the master alloy and Ni-modi ﬁed\nalloys are not only higher than that of traditional Co-base superalloy MAR-M 302 at the temperature ranging\nfrom 700 to 1000 °C, but also comparable with that of the commercial Ni-base superalloy IN-939 between 850\nand 1000 °C. In conclusion, the present Co-Ti-V-base alloys reinforced by γʹare suggested as potential candidates\nfor high-temperature utilizations.\n1. Introduction\nThe superalloys, which normally serve in severe industrial en-\nvironments facing high temperature and pressure, can be generally\ndivided into three classes named as nickel-, cobalt- and iron-base su-\nperalloys [1,2] . The melting point of nickel ( ∼1455 °C) is lower com-\npared with that of cobalt ( ∼1495 °C) and iron ( ∼1538 °C) [3,4] , and it\npartly suggests the higher possibility for cobalt- and iron-base super-\nalloys to be utilized at evaluated temperature than Ni-base superalloys.However, the fact is that the Ni-base superalloys reinforced by coherent\nfcc-ordered Ni\n3Al (L1 2structure) phase [5–8]are more widely utilized\nin nowadays industries than the other two types. It is believed that thelack of a coherent geometrically close-packed (GCP) phase in cobalt-\nand iron-base superalloys is the main limitation for their applications\n[2]. It needs to point out that the cobalt- and iron-base superalloys are\nstill playing a main role in some industrial ﬁelds including petro-\nchemical industries, nuclear power plants and gas turbine industries\netc. due to some reasons such as the less cost of iron-base superalloys\nand good resistance to high-temperature hot corrosion (HTHC) of co-\nbalt-base superalloys [2,9] .\nIn recent years, GCP phases were discovered in some Co-base\nternary alloys: Co-Al-W [10], Co-Ge-W [11] and Co-Ga-W [12]. Themost attractive aspects are high melting point (T\nm) and good mechan-\nical properties shown in Co-Al-W-base alloys [10]. Thus, many studies\nrelating to the Co-Al-W-base alloys were also conducted, for instance,\nthe in ﬂuence of alloying elements, Ta, Re, Cr, Ti, Nb, Mo, W, Mn, Fe, Ni,\nV and B, on mechanical properties, "

The ﬂow behavior and the microstructural mechanism ofthe synthesized superalloy were systematically studied. The processing map was constructed based onthe experiment data to evaluate the efﬁciency of power dissipation and recognize the instability regimesfor forging process determination. The processing map with the strain of 0.15 exhibits a smooth and smallvariation of /DC1and predicts a little instability regime conﬁned at ( T: 1050\n◦C,˙ε:1.0s−1), attributed to the\nprevious particle boundary (PPB) cracks. The map obtained at the strain of 0.65 reveals a large domainwith the efﬁciency above 40% and predicts two instability regimes at around (1050\n◦C, 1 s−1) and located\nin the regime of ( T: 1080–1140◦C,˙ε:0.002−0.01 s−1), respectively. The optimum processing condition\nis identiﬁed as ( T: 1140◦C,˙ε:1.0s−1), which presented the highest efﬁciency in hot working process,\nas well as the obtained ﬁne microstructure after the hot processing. Via microstructure characterizationand observation, it is concluded that the dynamic recrystallization (DRX) occurred at the PPBs in theP/M superalloy. The DRX and the strain rate sensitivity exponent mare both affected by true strain.\nThe local DRX presents a relatively low min a small strain compression. With an increase of strain, the\nfraction of the recrystallized grains increases with m. The global DRX, however, presents a relatively high\nmin a large strain compression. It is thus indicated that the superplasticity of FGH96 superalloy can be\nrealized at a slow strain rate such as 0.001 s\n−1and the deformation temperature of 1110◦C, near to the\n/H9253/prime-transus temperature, by using the uniformly ﬁne-grained superalloys as well as the high temperature\nsuperplastic forming equipment.\nCrown Copyright © 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\nThe successive development of superalloys has been motivated\nby the requirements in promoting the performance and ef ﬁciency\nof gas turbines in aerospace and power-generation industries. With\nsuperior corrosion, oxidation and wear resistance, the conventional\nCo-based superalloys have a microstructure consisting of a\ncontinuous Co solid-solution matrix ( g-Co SS) and various carbides,\nin which the carbides are the main strengthening phases [1,2] .\nHowever, the conventional Co-based superalloys exhibit lower\ntemperature capability in comparison with Ni-based superalloys,\nbecause the Ni-based superalloys are mainly strengthened by the\nstable intermetallic g0-Ni3Al precipitates and the coherent interface\nof the g/g0microstructure [3]. Recently, nano-size cuboidal L1 2-\ntype g0precipitate, i.e., an intermetallic compound Co 3(Al, W), has\nbeen found in the gmatrix of a Co-Al-W ternary [4]. This g0-Co 3(Al,W) phase introduces a strong combination of the strengthening\neffect of the precipitate and coherent interface, which enhances the\nhigh temperature strength to a level that is considerably greater\nthan that of the conventional Co-based alloys by 50 e100% [5e8].\nIn order to further develop this new class of superalloys as\npromising structural materials, macro-alloying the Co-Al-W ter-\nnaries by Ta, Nb, Mo, Hf and Ti [9e13] has been achieved to\ninvestigate the microstructural evolution including the elemental\npartitioning in each phase [9e11]and the g0solvus temperature\n[12,13] .

Results of the constant true strain rate compression tests are presented for initially ﬁne (7 /H9262m) and coarse (50 /H9262m) grained compacts\ndeformed at temperatures of 1050◦C, 1075◦C and 1100◦C and at strain rates in the range from 10−4s−1to 1 s−1. Under these test conditions, both\nthe ﬁne and coarse-grained compacts recrystallize and their grain size are reﬁned during ﬂow. This grain reﬁnement gives rise to softening in bothmaterials. Ultimately, their microstructures transform into the same equiaxed ﬁne-grained microduplex structure at which point their ﬂow strengt h\nbecomes identical. Continued deformation at that point produces no further change in grain size or ﬂow strength. Under this steady state regimeof deformation, the microduplex grain size and ﬂow strength are independent of the original microstructure but are conditioned by the strain rateat a given temperature. The steady state grain size increases whereas the steady ﬂow strength decreases with a decrease in strain rate and/or anincrease in temperature.© 2006 Elsevier B.V .

Nevertheless, limited investigations about microstructural degradation induced by the over-\nheating temperature and the effects on mechanical property of wrought superalloys were reported. Inthis paper, wrought superalloy GH4037 sectioned from an un-used 1\nststage turbine blade of an aircraft\nengine was adopted to investigate the microstructural degradation caused by short-time thermal\nexposure at very high temperature (higher than normal service temperature) and the microstructural\nevolution during the mechanical tests after the short-time thermal exposures. The effects of micro-structural degradation on mechanical properties including hardness, high temperature tensile properties\nand creep properties were also analyzed. The results indicate that gradual dissolutions of\ng0phase and\ngrain boundary (GB) carbides were the typical manifestation of microstructural degradation in GH4037alloy during the short-time thermal exposures at 1000 e1140\n/C14C for 3 min and 5 min. The dissolved g0\nphase and GB carbides re-precipitated in a very short time (less than 12 min) as ultra- ﬁne particles and\ncontinuous/cellular GB carbides during 850/C14C tensile tests and creep tests at 850/C14C/196 MPa. Due to the\nre-precipitated ultra- ﬁneg0phase, the tensile strength at 850/C14C after exposing to 1140/C14C for 3 min was\nanalogous to those of specimens without the thermal exposure. But the re-precipitated continuous/\ncellular GB carbides would cause the signi ﬁcant decrease of tensile ductility at 850/C14C and the creep\nelongation at 850/C14C/196 MPa. On the other hand, the dissolution of g0phase and GB carbides during the\nshort-time thermal exposures reduced the creep properties at 700/C14C/471 MPa signi ﬁcantly, as it took\nmuch longer time (more than 18.1 h) for the re-precipitation of g0phase when the overheated alloys\nwere exposed at 700/C14C/471 MPa.

All rights reserved.\nKeywords: Tension test; Intermetallic compound; Polyphase microstructure; Ductility; Co–Al–W-based alloys\nTraditional Co-based alloys have been widely used\nin turbine guide blades because of its high-temperature cor-\nrosion resistance, thermal fatigue resistance and ease of\nwelding [1]. The microstructures of the conventional Co-\nbased alloys mainly consist of continuous Co solid solution\nmatrix cphase with a face-centered cubic crystal structure\nand one or more carbides, in which the carbides are themain strengthening phases [2,3]. There is no coherent inter-\nface strengthening mechanism because the conventional\nCo-based alloys do not have a coherent c/c\n0microstructure\nlike that of Ni-based alloys [4,5].\nRecently, cuboidal L1 2-type c0phase, an intermetallic\ncompound Co 3(Al, W), has been found for the ﬁrst time\nin the cmatrix of a Co–Al–W ternary [6]. Wide concerns\nabout the phase stabilization, coherent microstructural\nevolution and mechanical behavior of the ternary have\nbeen generated since then by multi-alloying [7–12] . The\ndevelopment of strength and ductility in Co–Al–W-based\nalloys at room temperature and high temperatures is now\na primary issue. The high-temperature strength is positivelydependent on the stabilization of the c\n0phase, i.e. the c0\nsolvus temperature [7–9]. In the Co–Al–W ternary, the c0\nsolvus temperature can be improved by increasing the nom-\ninal Al and W contents [7]. First-principles calculations\nhave revealed that Mo, Ta, Rh, Ir and Pt can all stabilize\nthec0phase by dissolving in it, because all of these elementsinteract with the nearest neighboring Co, Al and/or W\natoms [10,11] . With a 2 at.% Ta addition, for example,\nthe solvus temperature of c0phase in the Co–9Al–9W al-\nloy is increased from 1000 to 1079 /C176C and the compres-\nsive strength at 800 /C176C is increased from 360 to\n580 MPa [7,8], which is superior to the conventional\nCo-based alloys [12]. B was found the most eﬀective\nalloying element to improve the ductility of the Co–Al–\nW ternary. A considerable increment in elongation of\n7.6% results, i.e. from 4.7% to 12.3%, in Co–9.2Al–9.5W alloy when doped with 0.02 at.% B [12]. This mech-\nanism of ductility enhancement is explained by suppres-\nsion of any intergranular fracture with B, discovered in\nthe Ni\n3Al single-phase polycrystalline alloys with very\nbrittle behavior and grain boundary failure [13,14] .\nIn the Co–9Al–9W ternary, 9 at.% W content increases\ndensity of the alloy to 9.543 g cm/C03.

METZLER1\n1.—Haynes International Inc., 1020 West Park Avenue, Kokomo, IN 46904, USA. 2.—e-mail:\nmfahrmann@haynesintl.com\nThe ability to accurately simulate the precipitation kinetics of c¢and other\nstrengthening phases in Ni-base superalloys is of great interest to industry.\nSeveral commercial simulation tools such as TC-PRISMA (Thermo-Calc,\nSweden) and PanPrecipitation (Computherm, USA) have been made available\nin recent years. This paper reports the outcome of a validation study on\nwrought Ni-base superalloy HAYNES/C210282/C210alloy for two scenarios of com-\nmercial interest: (1) the precipitation of c¢during continuous cooling, and (2)\nthe precipitation of c¢during two-step aging. The simulation results are vali-\ndated against experimental data. Any discrepancies are discussed in the\ncontext of the uncertainty in key material properties (such as interfacial\nenergies), model assumptions, and experimental errors.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe calculation of phase equilibria in multi-\ncomponent commercial superalloys by means of\nCALPHAD software (Thermo-Calc, Pandat, Chem-\nSage, etc.) is commonplace in the superalloys\nindustry. However, simulations of the important\nprecipitation kinetics of major strengthening\nphases in these alloys, most notably c¢, are\ncomparatively still at their infancy in industry.\nThis is partly because, until recently, commercial\nsimulation tools have not been available.1,2Also,\nconﬁdence in the ﬁdelity of these new simulation\ntools needs to be built over time. This requires\nextensive validation, most importantly on commer-\ncial alloys.\nThis study compares measured average c¢sizes\nwith simulated ones for two relevant heat-treating\nscenarios of new wrought c¢-strengthened\nHAYNES 282 alloy: (1) continuous cooling from\nannealing temperatures, and (2) the alloy’s recom-\nmended 2-step aging cycle. This particular alloy\nwas chosen because its chemical composition and\nphase constitution fall well into validated CAL-\nPHAD space. Moreover, the composition of the\nalloy in wrought form is reasonably uniform.\nLastly, the homogeneous precipitation of intra-\ngranular c¢, which is consistent with model\nassumptions and the basis of the alloy’s strength,\nwas the focus of this study.EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nThe studied material originated from a produc-\ntion heat of 282 alloy.

Introduction\nAt the present time, P :M superalloys are being used\nwidely for critical components of high-performanceaero-engines. Because of the severe working conditions,consistency in the microstructures and properties ofP:M superalloys components is essential for safety and\nreliability. The hot isostatic pressing (HIP) process is anindispensable step for the manufacturing of P :M super-\nalloys components. Thus, the investigation of micro-structure evolution during the HIP process of P :M\nsuperalloys can not only improve understanding of theHIP process, but can also provide guidance for deter-mining the optimal parameters of the HIP process.\nThe dynamic material modelling (DMM) method\nwas proposed by Gegel for dense materials [1] and hasbeen applied successfully in the prediction of mi-crostructure evolution during hot forming processesand in the determination of the stable regions of ther-momechanical parameters [1,2]. In this paper, referringto the DMM method, a new approach is proposed tomodel the dynamic behavior of P :M superalloys duringthe HIP process in order to reveal the microstructure\nevolution and control the quality of as-HIPed products.\n2. Method of dynamic behavior modeling for P :M\nsuperalloys\nFrom the thermodynamic viewpoint, hot-forming\nprocesses can be regarded as irreversible processes faraway from equilibrium conditions. The various mecha-nisms in operation during the processes are related tothe energy dissipative processes according to the dissi-pative structure theory. During hot-forming processes,the workpiece is the basic energy dissipative unit.Through it, the input deformation power is divided intotwo portions: plastic deformation energy and potentialenergy, the later being stored in the workpiece throughmicrostructure evolution. Accordingly, the dynamic be-havior of materials during hot-forming processes de-pends on the ratio of the above two portions.\nAs is illustrated in Fig. 1, at a given temperature and\nstrain, the instantaneous input deformation power P\nfor porous materials is given by:\nP\u001eY\nRo¯;R\u001e&o¯;R\n0YRdo¯;R\u001b&YR\n0o¯;RdYR (1) * Corresponding author.

High resolution\nDifferential Thermal Analysis (DTA) and thermodynamic modeling were used to design and perform\nsolution heat treatment experiments. Semi-analytical models are developed to describe the dissolutionand coarsening processes. The results from the proposed models, supported by electron microscopy\nobservations, indicate that coarsening occurs before complete dissolution takes place. Agglomeration is\nshown to be the governing coarsening mechanism for this alloy after calculation of the coef ﬁcients for\nboth the Ostwald ripening and agglomeration mechanisms. Electron microscopy observations revealedthat the early stages of agglomeration occur by neck formation between two neighboring particles. The\nsplitting of\ng0particles was identi ﬁed as one of the main dissolution mechanisms. Based on the obtained\nresults, a dissolution kinetics model is proposed to quantify the volume fraction of dissolved g0particles\nand estimate the activation energy of this process for AD730 ™. A coarsening model based on the time-\ntemperature dependence of the g0coarsening rate coef ﬁcient is also proposed taking the concentration of\nelements, g0volume fraction and the temperature into consideration. Based on this model, a method is\ndeveloped to predict g0size evolution during aging heat treatment process and an optimum heat\ntreatment to reach the desired g0distribution is proposed. The validity and accuracy of the proposed\nmodels were veri ﬁed by carrying out different heat treatment experiments.\n©2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\nThermomechanical processes such as rolling, forging,\nmachining and friction welding involve substantial microstructural\nchanges including dissolution and subsequent re-precipitation of g0\nprecipitates in Ni-based superalloys. These changes play a key rolein controlling the mechanical properties of these alloys. The ther-\nmal cycle (heating rate, temperature, and holding time) in addition\nto accumulated plastic strain and applied stress were found to\nenhance\ng0dissolution rate in Ni-based superalloys [1e4]. Out of\nthe parameters listed above, the heating stage plays a major role in\ndetermining optimum processing parameters. In addition, inthermal processes such as aging and creep, dissolution and coars-\nening of g0have a determining effect in property evolution.\nTherefore, g0size and volume fraction are critical inputs for models\nof mechanical behavior and microstructure evolution [5e7]. For\nreliable and accurate kinetics models to be developed, it is neces-\nsary to better understand the underlying mechanisms governing g0\nphase evolution during solution heat treatment (SHT).\nAfter solutionizing, aging is carried out "

Introduction\nThe widespread use of c0(L1 2)-precipitate-strengthened\nNi-base superalloys as a turbine blade material in high-temperature commercial and military jet engines andland-based gas turbines warrants extensive study of themicrostructural evolution and c\n0-coarsening behavior in\nmodel c(fcc)/ c0alloys, such as Ni-rich Ni–Al, Ni–Al–Cr\nand Ni–Al–Mo alloys [1–13] . In these alloys, elastic aniso-tropy leads to coherent precipitates evolving from spheres-\nto-cubes to arrays of cubes or to doublets or octets ofsmaller precipitates [1,8,14–17] , as well as face-to-face cube\nalignment along the elastically soft Æ100æ-crystallographic\ndirections [1,2]. In all cases, the morphology is dictated\nby the minimization of the interfacial free energy and elas-tic free energy arising from lattice parameter misﬁt, whilethe spatial correlations are controlled by elastic and diﬀu-\nsional interactions among neighboring precipitates. To\nimprove its high-temperature performance, modern com-mercial Ni-base superalloys contain as many as 12 or 13microalloying elements [18,19] . High-melting-point refrac-\ntory element additions, such as Nb, Re, Ru, W and Mo,are particularly eﬀective in improving creep resistance,\n1359-6454/$30.00 /C2112007 Acta Materialia Inc.

All rights reserved.\nKeywords: Nickel–cobalt base superalloys; Precipitation; Hardness test; Nanoindentation; Atomic force microscopy (AFM)\nPolycrystalline Ni base superalloys with a two-\nphase structure consisting of c-phase matrix (face-\ncentered cubic) and intermetallic c0-phase precipitates\n(L1 2) have been widely used as turbine disk materials\nin advanced aircraft engines owing to their excellent\nproperties such as high-temperature strength, creep and\nfatigue resistance, hot corrosion resistance, and oxida-tion resistance [1]. Superalloys develop high-temperature\nstrength through solid solutions [2], grain boundaries [3]\nand precipitate strengthening [4,5]. However, the contri-\nbution of each strengthening factor to the total strength\nof polycrystalline superalloys is not clearly understood\nbecause of their complicated microstructures, which nor-mally consist of ﬁne grains (in the 10–100 lm size range)\nandc\n0phases of variable sizes and volume fractions\n[6–10] . It is well known that trimodal distribution of\nthec0precipitates in a matrix provides a large degree of\nstrengthening and that the distribution varies depending\non the heat-treatment temperature and cooling rate\n[8,10] . The primary-generation c0-phase precipitates that\nremain undissolved during solution heat treatment at\nhigh temperature are more than approximately 1 lmi n\nsize and can be located on both the grain boundariesand within the grains themselves. The secondary-genera-\ntion c\n0-phase precipitates are medium sized, ranging\nfrom approximately 100 nm to 1 lm, and they nucleate\nduring cooling from solution temperature, and grow dur-\ning aging heat treatment at an intermediate temperature.The tertiary-generation c0-precipitates have the smallest\nsize, i.e. less than approximately 100 nm. Therefore, it\nis diﬃcult to analyze the contributions of such small pre-cipitates to the superalloy strength.\nSeveral attempts have been made to model the contribu-\ntion of each strengthening factor to the total strength of a\ntypical polycrystalline Ni base superalloy [9–11] . However,\nmost of these models have been consistently constructed\nusing quantitative calculation with limited experimental\nresults [9,10] or using alloys with simple microstructures\n[11]. Therefore, these models cannot divide or indicate\nclearly the contribution of each generation of precipitate\nto the total strength. Therefore, it would be time consum-ing and costly to explore the optimum combination of c\n0\nphases in a polycrystalline superalloy.\nAn indentation test is one of the most common tech-\nniques used to extract the local material properties at thenano-, sub-micron- or micron-scale [12–15] .

Due to the low stability  of the C14–Ni 2 Nb laves phase, it was prone to phase \nseparation,  and served as the nucleation  point for 𝜇, intergrown  𝜂/ 𝛿, and Nb 3 P phosphide  phases. \n1. Introduction  \nNickel based superalloys  are the ideal material  for hot section \ncomponents  of modern  gas turbine  engines  owing to their excellent  \ncreep properties,  high strength,  and considerable  fatigue resistance.  \nThese materials  are often subjected  to corrosive  environments,  high \nstress levels, and elevated  temperatures  during service [1,2] . As such, \nthe composition  of modern  Ni-based  superalloys  tends to be complex  in \norder to enhance  each property  and provide  adequate  resistance  against  \ndiﬀerent  failure modes. To achieve  this, a variety of major and minor \nalloying  elements  are utilized  to either increase  𝛾matrix solid-solution  \nstrength,  promote  stable 𝛾′ phase formation,  and suppress  undesired  \nsecondary  phase formation  [3] . For polycrystalline  superalloys,  used \nas turbine  disks or rotors, grain boundary  strength  and cohesion  are \ntremendously  important,  and minor trace elements,  e.g., B, C and Zr, \nare utilized  as these typically  segregate  to grain boundaries  and have \nbeneﬁcial  eﬀects [4–6] . \nWith aim to achieve  better properties,  scientists  have tried alloying  \nwith a variety of other elements,  one of which is phosphorous  [3,7] . \nThe eﬀect of trace P amounts  on the microstructure  and resulting  \nmaterial  properties  has been somewhat  ambiguous  "

INTRODUCTION\nNICKEL -BASE superalloys are widely used in\naerospace applications involving elevated-temperature\nservice but are generally considered diﬃcult to weld.\nNevertheless, a number of aerospace applications\nwould beneﬁt from hybrid (dual-/multi-alloy) struc-\ntures comprising superalloys with dissimilar mechanical\nproperties. For example, high-strength powder metal-\nlurgy (PM), or wrought superalloys are often beneﬁcial\nin locations that require high strength levels at mod-\nerate temperatures. Likewise, heat-resistant, coarse-\ngrain, or single-crystal cast superalloys are typically\npreferred in sections operating at higher temperatures\nor when creep resistance is critical. Several attempts\nhave been made to join these types of dissimilar alloys\nusing solid-state techniques such as friction weld-\ning.[1–4]In friction welding methods, the materials are\nbonded in the solid state using friction-induced heating\nof the mating surfaces which are brought together by\nan applied compression force. By this means, solidiﬁ-\ncation defects associated with fusion welding tech-\nniques are avoided. To produce a sound bond in\npractice, however, extensive plastic deformation andmechanical mixing of the materials at the mating\nsurfaces are required.[5]\nIn the speciﬁc process known as inertia friction\nwelding (IFW), the energy is supplied by a rotating\nﬂywheel, and the primary process parameters are the\nﬂywheel moment of inertia ( I), the initial ﬂywheel\nrotation speed ( xo), and the applied axial (forging)\nforce ( P).Iandxodeﬁne the initial kinetic energy of the\nﬂywheel Eko(also referred to as the welding energy):\nEko¼Ix2\no\n2: ½1/C138\nDuring the IFW process, the kinetic energy of the\nﬂywheel is transformed into heat viafriction at the weld\ninterface. The energy required to produce a sound weld\nis generally considered a suﬃcient criterion for a given\nmaterial combination and weld geometry.[6]However,\nEq. [ 1] indicates that numerous combinations of Iand\nxocan produce the same value of Eko.\nRecently, IFW was applied to join the forged, PM\nsuperalloy LSHR to coarse-grain, cast Mar-M247.[4]\nThe various welds exhibited two diﬀerent types of\nmechanical behavior during post-weld tension testing[7]:\n(1) plastic deformation and fracture on the Mar-M247\nside outside the heat-aﬀected zone (HAZ) or (2) fracture\nat the weld interface. For the latter failure mode,\nmicrostructural analysis revealed defects that weakened\nthe weld interface. These ﬂaws included s"

Additionally, post-yield hardening and softening\nrates are found to vary quite signi ﬁcantly within the narrow range of test temperatures examined. For a\nmodel to be able to consistently explain all these observations (a) it must explicitly account formicrostructural effects and temperature dependence, and (b) it must be aware of the speci ﬁc\nstrengthening mechanisms unique to nickel-based superalloys. Accordingly, the present effort starts\nwith Estrin's dislocation based framework (Estrin (1996) [4]), and then extends the same to incorporate\npost yield strengthening/softening mechanisms.

Development of a model for\nﬂow behavior of this material is essential for predicting location\nspeciﬁc properties in turbine disc components, and for development\nof a damage tolerant model.\nFor the last 45 years, there have been considerable efforts\ntowards constitutive modeling of stress –strain response of metal-\nlic materials [1–6]. An excellent review article on constitutive\ntheories can be found in [7]. Chaboche's own constitutive theories\n[8]are based on yield surface considerations. These involved\nchoice of the viscosity function following von Mises elastic domain\nequation and choice of isotropic and kinematic hardening equa-\ntions. These models are phenomenological in nature and are not\nmotivated by microstructure considerations. As a result, these are\nnot capable of predicting material response beyond the range of\nexperimental conditions used in the estimation of parameters.\nRoters et al. [9]have given a more recent overview of available\nconstitutive laws. They have clearly differentiated between phe-\nnomenological models, where the material state is only describedin terms of critical resolved shear stress and not in terms of lattice\ndefect populations, and physics based constitutive models, which\ntreat evolution of dislocation densities taken as internal variables,\nand calculate ﬂow stress from them. Prominent phenomenological\nmodels were formulated by Rice et al. [10], Hutchinson [11], and\nPeirce et al. [12,13] . Other notable phenomenological formulations\ninclude KHL model [14–18]and JC model [19]. Phenomenological\nmodels are limited by their applicability for a speci ﬁc set of\nconditions only. The aim of the present work is to develop a more\ngeneric physics based model wi"

Introduction\nPolycrystalline Ni-based disk superalloys are widely\nused as turbine disk materials in advanced aircraft enginesand land-based gas turbines because of their excellent ten-sile strength and creep properties, which depend mainly ontheir microstructure [1–3]. Normally, Ni-based superalloys\nare composed of a dual-phase microstructure in whichNi\n3(Al,Ti) intermetallic precipitates, designated c0, are\nembedded in a cmatrix with a face-centered cubic (fcc) dis-\nordered structure. Both phases can contain solution ele-\nments, such as Mo, Co, Cr (mainly in c), Ta, Nb (mainly\ninc0) and W (in both phases) [4]. Therefore, an Ni-based\ndisk alloy with a c/c0two-phase structure develops its\nstrength mainly from solid solution hardening, c0precipita-tion strengthening and grain boundary hardening. Solid\nsolution hardening [5,6] and grain boundary hardening\n[7–9] have both been well documented. However, the con-\ntribution of the c0precipitation strengthening is not yet\nclearly understood, because it depends on the complexmicrostructure, which in turn is aﬀected by the heat treat-ment conditions during both solution heat treatment andthe subsequent aging treatments.\nIf the solution heat treatment temperature is below the c\n0\nphase solvus (subsolvus), a ﬁne-grained microstructure can\nbe obtained because the undissolved c0precipitates ( /C241lm),\ncalled primary c0, pin the grain boundaries and restrict the\ngrain growth [10,11] . Supersolvus heat treatment dissolves\nthe primary c0, which produces a coarser-grained micro-\nstructure with no pinning of the grain boundaries. In bothcases, intragranular secondary and tertiary c\n0, typically at\nprecipitate diameters of approximately 100 and 30 nm andformed during cooling and the subsequent aging heat treat-\nments, respectively, are present within the cgrains.

The results\nindicate that 4 at.% Cr is suf ﬁcient to decrease the oxidation rate by two orders of magnitude. A creep\nstudy at 850+C revealed that Cr does not affect adversely the creep performance in high g’-volume\nfraction Co-based superalloys, but the tendency toward g’rafting changes with Cr concentration.\nCompared to Ni 3Al intermetallic compounds, the alloys with high g’-volume fraction studied exhibited a\nsigniﬁcantly higher creep resistance.

Introduction\nOver the past decade, the need for more ef ﬁcient aviation and\npower generation materials, has fueled a heightened interest in the\ndevelopment of Co-based superalloys consisting of a FCC matrix ( g)\nstrengthened by L1 2precipitates ( g’). These alloys, which are based\non the Co eAleW system, exhibit high solidus and liquidus tem-\nperatures, so that their maximum operating temperature may be\nhigher than for Ni-based g-g’superalloys [ 1,2]. Nevertheless,\nseveral challenges need to be overcame before these g’-strength-\nened Co-based superalloys can be employed commercially. The\ncurrently available Co-based superalloys exhibit a lower g’-solvustemperature than Ni-based superalloys, which limits their me-\nchanical and microstructural stability at high temperatures [ 3].\nMembers of the Co eAleW system, are also susceptible to oxidation\nand corrosion when prepared without the presence of Cr, a strong\noxidation-retarding element [ 4e6]. Moreover, Co-based superal-\nloys currently exhibit a lower mechanical creep strength than Ni-\nbased superalloys [ 7].\nThe necessity of adding chromium to all Co-based superalloys to\nimprove their oxidation resistance, is generally accepted. However,\nCr additions may affect different properties ranging from precipi-tate size to creep performance.

MONTAKHAB and E. BALIKCI\nThe nickel-base superalloys are unsurpassed for hot sections of the gas turbine engines whose\neﬃciency can be improved by developing new superalloys with enhanced properties. The\nartiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) method is utilized in alloy design of single-crystal nickel-basesuperalloys. The ANN method is especially powerful in applications where developing aphysically sound model is challenging such as alloy design with multiple components. A design\nspace of 45,000 alloy compositions is generated, and then a multilayer perceptron (MLP)\nfeed-forward (FF) artiﬁcial neural network is used to predict the density and creep lives of thesealloys. The ANN method is coupled with physics-based (PHACOMP) calculations to predict\nand then correlate the creep rupture life to the composition, precipitate volume fraction,\ntopologically closed packed phases, temperature, and stress. Then, an experimental alloycomposition is selected from the design space, and its solidiﬁcation behavior is investigated by a\nthermodynamics (CALPHAD)-based software. Moreover, single-crystal rods of the experi-\nmental alloy are grown and machined into creep samples, which are creep tested at threediﬀerent stress–temperature couples. A good match between the experimental results and theANN predictions is displayed in scatter plots and in Larson–Miller plots for the experimental\nalloy and for selected, well-known commercial single-crystal alloys. As the correlation of the\nmicrostructure to mechanical properties is still in its infancy by thermodynamics andmechanics-based software, an integrated ANN modeling is shown to be a powerful tool for\nﬁnding a composition and establishing relationships between the microstructure and properties\nof alloys. This, of course, can help reduce the material development cycle time as aimed by theIntegrated Computational Material Engineering (ICME).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s11661-019-05252-7\n/C211The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International 2019\nI.

A good combination of creep\nresistance, microstructure stability, and corrosion/oxi-dation resistance provided by Ni-base superalloys,makes them unsurpassed candidates as hot section\nturbine engine materials.

Introduction\nNi-based alloy is the conventional high-temperature structural\nmaterial due to its excellent high-temperature strength and creep\nresistance properties. Such metallic alloy are strengthened with\ndispersed L1 2-g0precipitations distributing among the FCC- gma-\ntrix. Since the discovery of a ternary g0-Co 3(Al,W) intermetallic\ncompound in the Al eCoeW system [1], Co-based alloy has been\nwidely investigated to develop superior high-temperature mate-\nrials [2e9]. Though the g0-Ni3Al with the L1 2structure is very stable\nand this phase exists in a wide composition range in the Ni eCoeAl\nternary system, the stability of the g0-Co 3(Al,W) phase in the\nAleCoeW ternary system remains contradictory [10e18]. The\nreviewed literature will be provided in the “literature survey ”\nsession. To understand the microstructure and subsequent prop-\nerty enhancement of Co-base alloys, knowledge on phase equilib-\nrium of the ternary Al eCoeW system and a reliable Al eCoeW\nrelated multicomponent thermodynamic database is necessary.\nThough the Co-rich corner of the Al eCoeW system has been\nthermodynamically evaluated by several researchers [17e19], in-\nformation on the phase equilibrium is still incomplete and even\ncontroversial, and especially isothermal section of the ternaryAleCoeW system in the whole composition range has not yet been\ndetermined. In the present work, an isothermal section of the\nAleCoeW system in the entire composition range at 600/C14C has\nbeen established experimentally with techniques combining opti-\ncal microscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy disper-\nsive x-ray spectroscopic capability (SEM-EDS), and x-ray\ndiffraction. This work is essential to accumulate the required phaseequilibria data for construction the Al eCoeW related thermody-\nnamic database.\n2. Literature survey\n2.1.

Microstructural analysis and assessment of the tensile\nproperties were performed on these samples. It was found that HIP led to the formation of (Hf,Zr)O 2\nparticles on prior particle boundaries (PPBs) which were not present in the as-received powder. It is\nsuggested that the oxides are formed by the diffusion of Hf and Zr from the interior of powder particles\nto the particle surfaces where oxygen level is usually high. When different HIP temperatures were used,no obvious effect on oxide size and distribution was observed but there was an effect on the\nmicrostructure and tensile properties. Thus, HIPing at super-solvus temperatures reduced the density\nof PPBs over the density observed in samples HIPed at sub-solvus temperatures by making grainswithin the original powder particles grow beyond the precipitates on PPBs, resulting in larger grainswith serrated boundaries. Slow cooling from HIPing temperatures also led to the formation of irregular-\nshaped\ng0. The 0.2% yield strengths at room temperature and at 700 1C were found to decrease with\nincrease of HIP temperature but the high temperature ultimate tensile strengths and elongationincreased considerably. Increasing HIPing temperature from sub-solvus to super-solvus temperatures\nalso led to the transition of fracture mode from interparticle debonding to transgranular fracture mode.\nCrown Copyright &2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Concurrent with the increase\nin strength is a signiﬁcant decrease in conventional hot work-\nability complicated by extensive segregation in the cast ingots.\nThe decrease in workability adversely affects the overall compo-\nnent cost and the ability to achieve the desired properties. This\nhas spurred the development of powder metallurgy (PM) techni-\nques for producing components of highly alloyed compositions to\nachieve the desired microstructures, properties, and cost effec-\ntiveness. One of the most common PM techniques is hot isostatic\npressing (HIPing) which enables production of fully consolidatedproduct with homogeneous microstructure. So far, HIPing has\nbeen used to consolidate advanced nickel-based powder super-\nalloys such as Rene 95 [1,2], Astroloy [3–5], APK1 [6], UDIMET\n720 [7], UDIMET 720LI [8], EP741NP [9], Inconel 718 [10–12] andFGH4096 [13]. Although some of the as-HIPed nickel-based\nsuperalloys such as Astroloy were reported to show comparable\nmechanical properties to their extruded þforged counterpart [5],\nmost of the directly HIPed nickel-based superalloys were found to\nsuffer from the presence of prior particle boundaries (PPBs) which\nare particularly detrimental to mechanical properties such as low\ncycle fatigue, high temperature d"

This paper presents an original method which dis-\ncriminates those phases on an orientation map by exploiting their chemical di ﬀerences. Performed with a\nFocused Ion Beam (FIB) microscope, the method is the combination of the ion CHanneling ORientation\nDetermination technique (iCHORD) –recently developed by Langlois et al. [1] –with the chemical information\nobtained from Secondary Ion (SI) images. The performances of the method are compared to the EDS-EBSD\ncoupling which also discriminates phases based on their chemical compositions. Applied ﬁlters, angular re-\nsolution, spatial resolution of the phase discrimination and acquisition time are discussed. It results that theiCHORD –SI combination o ﬀers an orientation map with an angular resolution slightly decreased compared to\nthat of the EBSD technique, but with a good phase resolution (down to 150 nm) and within a reasonable ac-quisition time. Thus, the iCHORD –SI combination appears to be an interesting method for the crystallographic\nsystems where phases are di ﬃcult to discriminate by the EBSD technique alone but present a signi ﬁcant che-\nmical contrast.\n1. Introduction\nDue to their superior resistance at high temperature, γ-γ′nickel-\nbased superalloys are used for the manufacturing of highly-constrained\naero-engine parts [ 2]. Their mechanical properties at high temperature\nresult from several features including the γ′phase distribution. Indeed,\ntheγ′phase forms precipitates of di ﬀerent sizes which are spread inside\ntheγmatrix, the ﬁner precipitates strengthening the alloy [ 3]. Many\ninteractions between the γgrains and the γ′precipitates occur during\nhot forging operations: deformation triggers recrystallization mechan-isms which closely depend on the precipitation and its evolution. For\ninstance, precipitates may dissolve to potentially reprecipitate behind\nthe front [ 4,5], pin grain boundaries [ 6] or act as nucleation sites [ 7,\n8]. Understanding these γ-γ′interactions enables the optimization of\nthe forging process so as to obtain the γ′phase distribution leading to\nthe best mechanical properties. Thus, for the γ-γ′microstructures the\ncharacterization of the respective phases is a real need.Electron Back-Scattered Di ﬀraction (EBSD) is commonly used to\ncharacterize polycrystalline microstructures. However, in the case of\ntheγ-γ′microstructures, this technique is not able to discriminate th"

Introduction\nSolution heat-treatments are common in nickel-based superal-\nloys and play a key role for the application of these materials athigh temperatures [1,2]. The objectives of this heat-treatment\nare the complete solutioning of γ′phase in the γmatrix and\nminimizing the segregation from non-equilibrium solidificationin preparation for the aging heat-treatment [3]. Then, by aging\nheat-treatments, it is possible to achieve a controlled γ′phase\nre-precipitation, producing a uniform and isotropic material [4].\nTheoretically, the solution heat-treatment should be carried\nout between γ′solvus and solidus temperatures in nickel-based\nsuperalloys, as described by Semiatin et al. [5]. However,\nsegregation from the non-equilibrium solidification limits thereal ‘window ’of treatment due to incipient melting below the\nsolidus temperature of the alloy. This ‘window ’is usually\nbetween 100 and 200 °C [6].Although the primary γ′precipitates dissolve quickly in\ntheγmatrix, a substantial time is required for the dissolution\nofγ/γ′eutectic regions and to minimize the segregation of the\nmaterial, because these materials usually have several heavyalloy elements that diffuse slowly in the matrix [7]. Typical\nsolution heat-treatments for conventional MAR-M247 super-alloy are carried out at 1230 °C for 2 h and 1250 °C for 4 and5 h, as published by Kattus [8], Gasko et al. [9]and Baldan [10],\nrespectively.\nAccording to literature, niobium is a refractory element that\nis normally present in the composition of nickel-based super-alloys, found mainly in the γ′phase (replacing aluminum) and\nin the formation of different types of carbides at the grain-boundaries [11,12] . Considering solution heat-treatment, niobi-\num increases γ′solvus temperature, avoiding the dissolution of\nthis phase at lower temperatures. Add"

Creep testing was carried out on standard specimens at 850 °C\nand under di ﬀerent stress levels. Experimental data demonstrated that the applied stress caused a reduction in\nthe creep lifetime, as a power law. Besides, scanning electron microcopy images showed that the mentioned\nmaterial had a brittle fracture with cleavage marks on the fracture surface of samples. In addition, optical\nmicroscopy images indicated the high e ﬀect of the applied stress on the carbides morphology. During higher the\ncreep lifetime, the length of carbides increased parallel to the force direction and caused to produce the trans-granular fracture. Then also, the amount of the\nγ,phase enhanced in the γmatrix, which caused to strengthen\nthe creep resistance of the material.\n1. Introduction\nNowadays, superalloys have been widely used in manufacturing of\nturbine blades, which operate in hot sections, weather in turbo-\nchargers of combustion engines or in gas turbines of aero engines.\nThe application in aviation and automotive industries is due to\nexcellent properties of superalloys, especially at high temperatures.\nIn other words, superalloys could work at high temperatures, close to\ntheir solvus temperature, where they have to withstand mechanical\nloads [1,2] .\nAccording to the rotational speed of blades, the centrifugal force is\ninduced in the material, where operating at high temperatures. Such\nloading leads to the creep phenomenon, which requires a constant load\nand high temperatures. Turbine blades are subjected to elevated\ntemperatures under medium stresses for a prolonged time; therefore,\nthe creep phenomenon will be a major mode of damages. Such creep\ndeformation at high temperatures can lead to micro-cracking and the\nultimate fracture; and therefore, is one of main mechanisms that limits\nthe component lifetime, besides thermo-mechanical fatigue damages\n[1,2] . For designing such costly high-reliable parts, knowing the creep\nbehavior has an important rule. Therefore, several researches havebeen represented on the creep behavior of superalloys, besides\ninvestigating related failure mechanisms.\nAbu-Haiba et al. [3]studied the creep deformation and the\nmonotonic stress-strain behavior of Haynes-556 superalloy at elevatedtemperatures, using analytical models. However, results of the\nθ\nprojection method were accurate predictions of the rupture lifetime;while the Garofalo model over-estimated them. Hou et al. [4]presented\nthe microstructure and mechanical properties of the cast Ni-based K44superalloy. They demonstrated that tensile properties and creep\nbehaviors had abnormal variations with increasing the temperatures,\nand the creep data could be ﬁtted well with the modi ﬁed Dyson-\nMcLean relation. Marahleh et al. [5]predicted the creep lifetime of\nservice-exposed turbine blades by the Larson-Miller parameter. They\nindicated that th"

[1]provides a\npossibility to develop a new class of γ0-strengthened Co-base super-\nalloys. Solidus and liquidus of Co –Al–W-base alloys are about 100 –\n150 1C higher than those of advanced Ni -based single-crystal super-\nalloys [2]. Compared to Ni-base single-crystal alloys, segregation of\nconstituent elements in the dendritic structure in single-crystals Co-\nbase alloys is very limited [3], resulting in a higher resistance to the\nformation of convective instabilities and freckles. A pronounced ﬂow\nstress anomaly is observed in the quaternary or ternary Co –Al–W\nsystem and their strength is much higher than that of conventional\nCo-base superalloys strengthened by refractory elements and car-\nbides [4]. These studies provide further motivation to investigate the\nhigh temperature creep properties of the new Co-base alloys [5,6,8 –\n10], which is a dominant mode of deformation for single crystal\nturbine blades used in gas turbine engines. The primary researches on\nthe effect of alloying elements on the creep strength suggest that the\naddition of Ta or Ti to the ternary Co –Al–Ws y s t e mi sb e n e ﬁcial to the\ncreep properties [5]while the creep strength of Co –7.8Al –7.8W –1.5Ta\n(at%) is decreased obviously with a 4.5 at% Cr addition [5]. It seems\nthat the addition of Cr is detrimental and the addition of Ta may not\noverwhelm the negative Cr effect.

Introduction\nNickel-base superalloys are one of the most widely used materials\nfor high-temperature applications in aero engines and stationary gas\nturbines. They have excellent thermal and mechanical stability at high\ntemperature, which allows them to operate at temperatures close to\ntheir melting point. Their extraordinary properties are associated with\ntheir complex chemical composition, which contains high amount of\nrefractory elements such as W, Ta and Re, as well as their micro-\nstructure, consisting of coherent secondary γ′ precipitates embedded in\nthe solid-solution γ matrix [1,2]. However, due to the rotational\nmovements of hot-section components at very high temperatures, they\nsuffer from material losses due to creep, thermal induced stresses,\nthermal abrasion, corrosion, and oxidation. As consequence, these\ncomponents must be repaired or, in the worst case, completely replaced\nduring the overhaul, which is very expensive [3]. Hence, there is great\ncommercial interest in developing repair processes based on additive\nmanufacturing (AM) that are capable of restoring the metallurgical\nmicrostructure and geometry of the parent material at damage locations\n[3,4]. On the other hand, the potential to produce turbine components\nwith a complex shape from Ni-base superalloys makes AM technologyvery attractive.The second-generation single-crystal (SX) Ni-base superalloy CMSX-\n4 exhibits the typical microstructural heterogeneities associated withdendritic growth during casting, such as strong segregation between\ndendritic and interdendritic regions, large eutectic areas, topologically\nclose-packed (TCP) phases as well as porosity [1,2]. To reduce these\nheterogeneities, complex and long heat treatments are required to\nachieve a homogeneous chemical composition, to dissolve large γ/γ′\neutectics and to "

All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\nCo–Al–W ternary system has attracted much attention recently\nfor the existence of a stable c0-Co 3(Al, W) phase with an ordered\nL12structure [1,2] . The c0phase was reported to be stabilized\ntoward higher temperatures by the addition of alloying elements,\nsuch as Ta, Ti and Ni [1,3,4] . These cobalt-base alloys have a\nmelting temperature higher than that of nickel-base superalloys\nand potentially offer higher temperature capacity. New c/c0\nCo–Al–W–Ti alloys with appropriated Ti-alloying level can increasethe high temperature capacity without much secondary phase\nprecipitation, meanwhile result in the lower density than that of\nCo–Al–W and other quaternary alloys, which provide much\nmotivation for their future use in gas turbine engines.\nThe solidiﬁcation microstructure formation can provide useful\ninformation, not only for subsequently required heat treatments\nbut also for the casting process itself. In Ni-base superalloys, much\nof this knowledge has been effectively applied to understand the\nsolidiﬁcation behavior and evaluate the casting properties and\nsolidiﬁcation defects [5,6] . Many studies were conducted on the\nsolidiﬁcation path, microsegregation and the euctetic phase forma-\ntion, which may have strong inﬂuence on ﬁnal as-cast and subse-\nquently heat-treated microstructures [5,7,8] . In Co-base Co–Al–W\nalloys, however, there are still no reports on the solidiﬁcation\nmicrostructure formation, especially on the details of the last stageof solidiﬁcation and eutectic formation. It is necessary to under-\nstand the microstructure formation process of the Co–Al–W alloysin order to promote their applications.\nLiquid metal cooling (LMC) Bridgman directional solidiﬁcation\nis one of important ways to fabricate the single crystal superalloys\nas well as one of effective methods to investigate the solidiﬁcation\npath through quenching performed during the directional solidiﬁ-\ncation [9,10] .

The existence of tungsten in the superalloy stabilizes the DO 22superlattices, which are\ntransient metastable phases in Ni–Cr–Mo alloy. Because of the ﬁne, spherical and dispersed precipitates in the Ni–Cr–W matrix, themicrohardness of the alloy is improved remarkably./C2112013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\nKeywords: DO 22superlattice; Ni–Cr–W superalloy; Ageing; High thermal stability\nNi–Cr–W-based superalloys with excellent\nmechanical strength and long-term creep rupture\nstrength have been developed recently [1]. They have\ngreat potential in the ﬁeld of nuclear industry [2].I t\nhas been reported [3]that Haynes 230, with a nominal\ncomposition of Ni–22Cr–14W (in wt.%), is a very prom-\nising candidate as the heat exchanger in the fourth-generation supercritical water-cooled reactor system(GEN IV SCWR). In order to meet the demands of\nthe GEN IV SCWR program, particular attention has\nbeen focused on the lasting creep performance of theHaynes 230 alloy [4,5]. Kakehi [6]has reported that\nsecondary precipitates have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the\ncreep strength of Ni-based superalloys, which suggeststhat creep resistance can be improved by superlattice\nprecipitation.\nIt has been proved that the superlattices precipitate\nthrough order–disorder transformation in some Ni–Cr-\nbased and Ni–Mo-based superalloys, and these ordered\nparticles play a dominate role in improving the mechan-ical properties of the Ni-based superalloys [7–13] .I ti s\nknown that the closely related Pt\n2Mo-type, DO 22\nand D1 asuperlattices can precipitate after a series oflong-range ordering reactions in Ni–Mo alloy and/or\nNi–Cr–Mo alloy [14,15] .\nHowever, the precipitation of superlattices in the ter-\nnary system Ni–Cr–W superalloy during prolongedexposure to proper temperature has not yet been spe-\ncially studied. The understanding of the microstructural\nchanges occurring in this superalloy during long periodsof ageing may help in the prediction of its applicationlife. Rtishchev et al. [16]found that the orthorhombic\nNi\n2(Cr,W,Mo) superlattice precipitates in the matrix\nduring long-term ageing in some Ni–Cr–W–Mo superal-loys. Nevertheless, the superlattice in the Ni-based alloy\nwith high tungsten content has rarely been reported on.\nChatterjee and Roy [17]seemed to have found that the\nNi\n2(Cr,W) superlattice exerts a positive inﬂuence on\nthe creep performance of Haynes 230 alloy. However,\nthe precipitates which they considered to be Pt 2Mo-type\nsuperlattice were probably carbide, judging from the\nsize, morphology and electron diﬀraction patterns of\nthe phase.\nIn this letter, the crystallographic changes occurring\nduring long-term exposure to an appropriate tempera-\nture in the Ni–Cr–W-based superalloy were studied with\nthree primary objectives: ﬁrst, to determine whethersuperlattices will precipitate in the Ni-based alloy, which\nis a solid-solution-strengthened austenitic superalloy\nwith a high tungsten content; secondly, to identify whichtype of superlattice is thermodynamically st"

Mo addition  does not \ninfluence the volume fraction of the γ′ phase ; however , the morphology of the γ′ phase changes from \ncuboidal to near cuboidal . The μ phase  and β phase  were  identified in both alloy system s. Although \nthe melting point of the μ phase  is decreased by Mo addition , the solidification paths remain  the \nsame: L→ L1 + γ → L 2 + γ + μ → γ + μ + β → γ + μ + β + γ′. The precipitation of a γ′ phase envelop \naround the interdendritic regions  in Co -Al-W alloy systems  has never been reported . The formation \nof a surrounding γ′ phase was caused by  the diffusion of elements between secondary phases and the \nsubstrate  during the heat treatments . The microhardness  of the μ phase , which can be easily \ninfluenced by Mo addition , is the highest in both alloys , followed by the microhardness es of the β \nphase  and the substrate.

INTRODUCTION\nNICKEL -BASE superalloys have emerged as the\ncandidate materials for high-temperature applications,\nwhere resistance to fracture under static, fatigue, and creep\nconditions is decisive.[1,2]In gas turbines, for instance, the\nblades operate at high temperature and, thus, require\noutstanding creep resistance. On the other hand, the disks\noperate at lower temperatures but higher loading condi-\ntions and, thus, require excellent fatigue resistance.[1,2]\nTherefore, there are several advantages from the develop-\nment of a multifunctional single component. Such a\ncomponent can work well under distinct temperature\nregimes and loading conditions, e.g.,t u r b i n e blisks .\nRecently, to meet these requirements, there have been a\nnumber of new trends in superalloys and processes. NASA\ndesigned the dual-microstructure heat-treatment technol-\nogy in which the microstructural and property variation\ncan be achieved within any given component.[3,4]Another\nfavorable way diﬀerent superalloys are joined into one\nstructure.[5–8]As a suitable method of joining dissimilar\nalloys, friction welding is generally accepted as an alterna-\ntive process in this hybrid approach.[5–13]\nFriction welding has been used recently to join a cast\nMAR-M247 with a forged INCONEL 718.* They arecandidate superalloys for turbine blisks.[1,2,14]The\nmechanical properties of the welding were experimen-\ntally investigated under various loading conditions by\nOkazaki et al.[6]The welding was strong under mono-\ntonic and fatigue loadings. When the dissimilar joint is\naddressed to use at elevated temperatures, the so-called\ncreep fatigue and thermomechanical fatigue need to be\ninvestigated. Here, several mechanical and metallurgical\nfactors are simultaneously considered. From a metal-\nlurgical aspect, the dissolution or coarsening of the main\nstrengthening precipitates and the recrystallized\nmicrostructure might be the important issues.[11,12,15–18]\nFrom a mechanistic viewpoint, the stress concentration\nresulting from the incompatibility of mechanical prop-\nerties could be a critical concern.\nThe objective of this work is to explore the role of the\nstress multiaxiality induced by the inhomogeneous\nproperties along the welding. For this purpose, the\ncreep-fatigue behavior of the welding was assessed by\nthe experiments. Then the stress ﬁeld in the welded zone\nwas numerically analyzed using a visco-elastic model,\nemploying two kinds of damage parameters proposed\nby Huddleston[19]and Spindler.[20]\nII.

Bre ´chet\nReceived: 23 February 2010 / Accepted: 17 May 2010 / Published online: 8 June 2010\n/C211Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010\nAbstract A microgrid extensometry method has been\ndeveloped and used to obtain information about intra-\ngranular and intergranular creep mechanisms. An oxidegrid was deposited on a creep specimen using an electron\nlithography technique. This oxide grid offers high back-\nscattered electron contrast and can withstand long durationcreep tests under vacuum in the 700–850 /C176C range without\ndegradation. Speciﬁc methods were used to measure in-\nplane displacements at the grid nodes or at the grainboundaries using correlation of grid images taken before\nand after the creep test. The local strain and grain boundary\nsliding (GBS) data were then calculated. Combined infor-mation about grain boundary crystallography and GBS has\nbeen obtained by superimposing the electron backscattered\ndiffraction (EBSD) map on the deformation maps. Toillustrate the potential of this set of processes, two exam-\nples of application on a nickel-base disc superalloy are\npresented. The ﬁrst one concerns the inﬂuence of the creeptemperature on the local strain and the GBS. The second\napplication quantitatively shows the inﬂuence of grain\nboundary character on GBS of this material.Introduction\nThe development of creep resistant alloys is becoming\nmore and more a key engineering issue, for propulsion\nengine in aeronautics as well as for thermal or nuclear\nenergy production. There is an abundant literature on creepmechanisms, either intragranular (diffusional creep or\ndislocation mediated creep), or, to a lesser extent, inter-\ngranular (grain boundary sliding), and the Ashby defor-mation maps provide a guideline to estimate the relative\nimportance of the various mechanisms for steady state\nconditions [ 1]. However, the detailed and quantitative\nexperimental information on the effect of temperature,\napplied stress and global strain on the occurrence of grain\nboundary sliding (GBS), for industrial alloys, is sparse.In the perspective of possible grain boundary engineering,\nit is also of relevance to obtain information on the inﬂuence\nof grain boundary (GB) crystallographic character. Gettingthis information requires a tool providing local data on the\nmagnitude of intragranular deformation and GBS, at the\nsame time as local data about crystallographic nature of\ngrains boundaries and crystallographic orientation of\ngrains.\nGrids or microgrids, developed in the 1970s to replace\nthe scratch technique [ 2–4], are widely used for GBS\nanalysis. The grid technique presents the advantage of atwo-direction measurement in the plane of the sample\nsurface, over the unidirectional one provided by the scratch\ntechnique. Gold or platinum microgrids are generally usedfor micromechanical investigations at room or intermediate\ntemperatures (up to 500 /C176C) [4–6]. However, at higher\ntemperatures, thermal and environmental degradations arerapidly becoming a serious issue. As an alternative, internal\nmicrogrids engraved by etching were used to study the\ndeformation of a duplex stainless steel at 1050 /C176C in air\nA. Soula /C1D. Locq (&)/C1D. Boivin /C1Y.

Introduction\nNickel-based superalloys are complex alloys that are\nwidely used for gas turbine components that are exposed toboth high temperatures and high stresses, namely, turbineblades and vanes [1]. Single crystal nickel-based superal-\nloys, which exhibit increased creep strength in comparisonto conventionally cast and directionally solidiﬁed superal-loys, are used for these components in order to increase theperformanceandefﬁciencyofaircraftandpowergeneratinggas turbines. Industrial gas turbines have traditionally usedturbine blades fabricated from equiaxed polycrystalline castnickel based superalloys due to lower operating tempera-tures compared to aircraft gas turbines. However, the needto increase the efﬁciency of industrial gas turbines requiresincreasing the turbine inlet temperature and, consequently,the use of single crystal nickel base superalloys for theturbine vanes and blades.\n∗Corresponding author.

Introduction\nThe discovery of the relatively stable γ0-Co 3(Al,W) phase with\nL12structure in the ternary Co –Al–W system by Sato et al. [1]has\ngenerated substantial interest. A series of experimental [1–6]and\ncomputational [7]efforts have been done to study the micro-\nstructure stability and mechanical properties of the new Co-base\nalloys, suggesting that Co 3(Al,W) can be practically used as the\nstrengthening phase. However, large amount of W ( /C2425 wt%) is\nadded to stabilize Co 3(Al,W) in the Co –Al–W-base alloys, leading\nto a high density, and the γ0solvus temperature is lower compared\nto Ni-base superalloys. A recent investigation by Shinagawa et al.\n[3]indicates that substitution of Ni for W can stabilize the γ0phase\nand increase the γ0solvus temperature. This provides a way to\ndecrease the heavy density. In the ternary Co –Al–W system, with a\n2 at% Ta addition, the yield strength as well as the solvus\ntemperature of γ0phase is increased obviously [4], whereas a\ncombined addition of certain amount Cr and Ta can signi ﬁcantly\ndecrease the γ0solvus temperature as well as high-temperature\nstrength [4]. A combined addition of Cr and Ni to ternary Co –Al–W\nsystem can improve the γ0solvus temperature [5]. These results\nreveal that the interactions between alloying elements affect the\nmicrostructure and mechanical properties. So far, the effect\nof Ta additions on the microstructure and mechanical behaviorsof a multinary Co –Al–W–Ni–Cr alloy system has not been shown\nsystematically. In this research, Co –9.5 at% Al –5 at% W –16 at% Ni –\n6 at% Cr was used as the basic composition, in which a portion ofW was substituted by Ni, and 1.8 at% and 2.8 at% Ta was added to\nexplore its effect on its microstructure and mechanical properties.\n2. Experimental procedure\nThe master alloys were melted in a vacuum induction furnace,\nand then directionally solidi ﬁed into [0 0 1] single crystal rods at a\nconstant withdraw rate of 6 mm/min in Bridgeman type furnace.\nThe melting point of alloys and\nγ0solvus temperature were\ndetermined by Differential Thermal Analysis. All single crystal\nrods were homogenized at 1300 1C for 8 h in a vacuum, followed\nby furnace cooling, and then annealed at 850 1C, 950 1C and\n1000 1C for 36 h for 0Ta, 1.8Ta and 2.8Ta, respectively.

INTRODUCTION\nNI-BASED superalloys are utilized for turbine disks,\nblades, and jet engines owing to their high oxidation and\ncorrosion resistance, and their excellent strength and\ncreep behavior at ambient and elevated tempera-\ntures.[1,2]Ni-based superalloys are strengthened by\ncoherent (L1 2) precipitates ( c0) with a base stoichiometry\nof Ni 3Al in a (fcc) Ni-rich matrix ( c).[3,4]Challenges\nremain, however, in both high-temperature strength[5]\nand hot-corrosion resistance[6,7]for Ni-based superal-\nloys, indicating a need for new high-temperature alloys.\nIn 2006, the c0-Co 3(Al,W) phase, with a solvus temper-\nature up to 1273 K (1000 /C176C), was reported in a new\nCo-based superalloy with the base composition\nCo-9.2Al-9W at. pct,[8]analogous to the c0-Ni3(Al,Ti)\nof Ni-based superalloys. Subsequent studies examined\nadditions of Ti and Ta, which increase the solvus\ntemperature and volume fraction of c0.[9]Ductility is also\nenhanced in polycrystalline material with boron addi-\ntions that strengthen the grain boundaries and sup-\npresses intergranular fracture.[10]Creep resistance of\nCo-based alloys is increased with the addition of e.g.,\nCr, Mo, Ti, and Ta.[11–13]Furthermore, additions ofTa,[14]Si[15], and Cr[16]increase oxidation resistance. The\naddition, however, of large quantities of W in these\nCo-based superalloys results in drawbacks. First, the\nlow diﬀusivity of W[17]makes it diﬃcult to homogenize\nthe alloy. Second, the strength-to-weight ratio, which is\nessential for turbine blades, is lower due to the high\ndensity of W (yielding densities >9:3 gcm/C03). Finally,\nthe presence of W results in deleterious precipitates,\nsuch as DO 19(Co 3W).[18]In 2015, a new class of W-free\nCo-based superalloys was described[19,20]with a base\ncomposition Co-10Al-5Mo-2Nb at. pct. The microstruc-\nture of this alloy is analogous to Co-Al-W alloys with\ncuboidal c0[Co 3(Al, Mo, Nb)] precipitates coherently\ndistributed in a c-fcc Co-based matrix. With additions of\nNi up to 30 at. pct, the solvus temperature is increased\nfrom 1159 K (886 /C176C) to 1263 K (990 /C176C), and the c0\nvolume fraction is increased from 54 to 76 pct.[20]The\ndensity of the W-free alloys is decreased to 8 :4gcm/C03\nwhen compared to 9 :2gcm/C03for Co-7Al-7W at. pct.[20]\nThe speciﬁc strength is also substantially improved. The\nspeciﬁc strength reported for Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb is\n96MPa =ðgcm/C03Þas compared to 79MPa"

NEMBACH \nInstitut fiir Metallforschung der Universitat Miinster, Wilhelm-Klemm-Stral3e 10, D-48149 Miinster, \nGermany \n(Received 2 February 1996; accepted I1 April 1996) \nAbstract-The formation of precipitate free zones (PFZ) along large and small angle grain boundaries \nhas been investigated for bi- and polycrystals of the nickel-base superalloy NIMONIC PE16. This material \nis strengthened by coherent precipitates of the y’-phase. The most important result is that the PFZs are \ncaused by the growth of titanium-rich carbides in the grain boundaries. Since titanium is a constituent \nof the y’-precipitates, its depletion along the grain boundaries leads to the dissolution of the y’-particles \nand hence to PFZs. The former belief that they are due to chromium-rich grain boundary carbides is \ndisproved. \nThe growth rate of the width w of the PFZs is controlled by the volume diffusion of titanium. Until \nM/ reaches its final value WM, w is proportional to the square root of the aging time. The growth rate \nof the PFZs yields the volume diffusion coefficient of titanium. The WM is probably governed by the grain \nboundaries’ limited capacity to accommodate titanium-rich carbides.

INTRODUCTION \nGrain boundaries (GB) may affect the yield strength \nof precipitation hardened polycrystals via two \ndifferent channels: \n(i) GBs may act as dislocation sources and they \nlimit the slip length. \n(ii) There may be precipitate-free zones (PFZ) \nalong the GBs.

Introduction\nThe nickel-base superalloy IN792 is a cast polycrystalline mate-\nrial which is widely used in industrial and aircraft turbines due toits high strength and excellent hot corrosion resistance [1,2] . Like\nmost nickel-based superalloys it is intended to withstand extremeconditions of temperature and loading during many years of oper-ation before the scheduled removal of components during enginerefurbishment. IN792 belongs to an important class of material andcan typically be found in critical components such as turbine bladesand vanes. Even though such components sometimes are made insingle crystalline form, polycrystalline materials are very commondue to lower costs and easier production route [3].\nThe critical turbine parts are subjected to very signiﬁcant and\ntime dependent stress ﬁelds during service and the origin of thestresses is the combination of external forces and the tempera-ture gradients which are generated during engine start-up and shutdown.

The interdiffusion coefﬁcients were found to\nbe close to those reported for these elements in Ni-base\nalloys. Combining the diffusion simulation software DIC-\nTRA with the Ni-base diffusion databases TCNi 5and\nMobNi 3, the interdiffusion proﬁles of Co, Al W, and Ta\nwere modeled for Co9Al8W2Ta/Co diffusion couples\nannealed at different temperatures and for different times.\nThe results show that interdiffusion in the Co-Al-W-Ta\nalloys can be modeled reasonably well using the available\ncommercial databases for thermodynamics and kinetics of\nNi-base systems.\nKeywords alloys /C1interdiffusion /C1modeling1 Introduction\nCo-base superalloys are a new class of high-temperature\nmaterials still under development, which have c/c0-mi-\ncrostructures similar to those of Ni-base superalloys.[1]One\nof the promising alloy subsystems within this group is Co-\nAl-W-Ta, where Co is the base, Al is a c0-forming element,\nW is a solid-solution strengthener of the c-matrix and a c0-\nstabilizer, and Ta increases the c0solvus temperature. It is\nexpected that c0-strengthened Co-base alloys might sub-\nstitute Ni-base superalloys in selected high-temperature\napplications. Therefore, many research groups intensively\ndevelop and investigate alloys of this system, e.g. Ref 2-15.\nModeling of processes controlled by diffusion, such as\ncreep deformation, oxidation, homogenization during heat\ntreatment, and evolution of the microstructures at high\ntemperatures, requires reliable diffusion data for the system\nunder study. Databases for this purpose are therefore\ndesired, but currently the number of reports contributing\nsuch data for Co-base alloys is comparatively small, e.g.\nRef8,9,14. Occasionally, research groups use diffusion\ndata for Ni-base alloys instead, available from the well-\ndeveloped diffusion databases for Ni-base alloys, like in\nRef15. However, the applicability of Ni-base data to the\nmodeling of Co-base alloys lacks any veriﬁcation.\nThe aim of the present work is to investigate the dif-\nfusion mobility of alloying elements in the Co-rich part of\nthe Co-Al-W-Ta system. The interdiffusion coefﬁcients\nobtained experimentally are presented in comparison with\nthose reported in literature for Co- and Ni-base alloys. The\nmeasured concentration proﬁles are compared to proﬁles\nmodeled with the diffusion simulation software DICTRA\nin combination with the commercial databases TCNi 5and\nMobNi 3. The validity of such simulations, using diffusion\ndata for Ni in place of that for Co, is discussed.\n&A.

For the first time, a nanoscale lamellar γ/γ ׳ structure was obtained along the \nelastically soft [100] direction by a eutectoid -like reaction from a severely deformed matrix.  In addition, the \npreferred distribution of semi -coherent Y 2Hf2O7 oxide particles was observed only in the γ phase due to the \nprior partitioning of Y and O to this phase. The microstructure development during the processing route is \ndiscussed based on the solvus temperature of this new ODS superalloy in comparison to commercial ODS \nsuperalloys.  \nKeywords: Metals and all oys; Ni -based ODS superalloy ; Microstructure ; lamellar γ/γ´ structure; \nY2Hf2O7 oxide particles  \n1. Introduction  \nNickel -based oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) superalloys produced by mechanical alloying are \npromising materials as the next generation of superalloys for modern gas turbines i n advanced aerospace \nand power plant applications [1 -4]. For this purpose, the microstructure development for promoting high -\ntemperature strength is of significant importance. Precipitation hardening is the main strengthening \nmechanism of superalloys, as a chieved by the L1 2 ordered γ ׳ precipitates embedded coherently in the fcc γ \nmatrix. The morphology and distribution of the γ′ phase inside the γ matrix strongly affects high -\ntemperature properties [5,6]. As reported in the literature [1,2,7], up to now, the “spherical” or “ cuboidal” \nshapes are the usual morphologies of γ׳ , which have been characterized in single crystal superalloys \n(CMSX10, etc.) or commercial ODS superalloys (MA6000 and MA760, etc.).

Knowlesb\naDepartment of Engineering Science, Oxford University, Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PJ, UK\nbRolls Royce University Technology Centre, Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, University of Cambridge,\nCambridge CB2 3QZ, UK\nReceived 21 October 2001; received in revised form 28 February 2002; accepted 28 February 2002\nAbstract\nThe polycrystalline nickel-base superalloy (C263) is used for stationary components in aero-engines such as combus-\ntion chambers, casings, liners, exhaust ducting and bearing housings. It is a ﬁne-precipitate strengthened alloy at 800 °C,\nwith a precipitate solvus temperature of 925 °C. Below the solvus, the precipitate coarsens at elevated temperature. A\ncritical precipitate size exists below which particle cutting is the rate-controlling creep mechanism. Above the criticalsize, it is dislocation pinning and climb. Once the solvus temperature has been exceeded, however, the rate-controlling\nmechanism becomes pinning and climb within a dislocation network.\nThis paper presents physically-based constitutive equations for creep deformation in C263. In the presence of the g/H11032\nprecipitate, populations of climbing and gliding dislocations are assumed to exist in a similar way to that proposed by\nDyson and Osgerby [3]. Climbing dislocations are assumed to be pinned at precipitates. The dependence of steadystate glide dislocation ﬂux can then be obtained as a function of precipitate volume fraction. Above the g/H11032solvus, the\npinning process is different and results from the establishment of a dislocation network, the size of which determines\nthe pinning distance. The physical constants arising in the equations have been determined by the conventional minimis-ation of errors between experimental and calculated creep curves. They have also been determined quite independently\nusing fundamental data and experiments. Remarkable agreement between the two sets of physical constants is achieved.\nThe constitutive equations have been shown to capture the material’s creep deformation characteristics over a broadrange of temperature, both below and above the g/H11032solvus. In addition, the effect of precipitate coarsening on creep\nrate is correctly captured, together with the effect of prior ageing on subsequent creep rate.\nThe damage processes of cavitation and multiplication of mobile dislocation density have been coupled with the\nconstitutive equations and used to predict failure in constant and variable stress creep. 2002 Acta Materialia Inc.\nPublished by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Comparing the\nalloys 7Al-3.5Ti, 5.5Al-4.2Ti and 4Al-4.9Ti with the similar hot workability, the Al(at%)/Ti(at%) in the γ′de-\ncreased with the decrease of Al(at%)/Ti(at%) in the alloys, this composition change in the γ′made the alloys ’\nyield strength at room temperature and 800 °C increase from 915 MPa to 1025 MPa and from 764 MPa to\n826 MPa, respectively. Based on the 6Al-3.5Ti alloy, the addition of 1 at% Al changed the γ′compositions, which\nresulted in a decrease of yield strength at room temperature by 45 MPa but a signi ﬁcant increase of yield\nstrength by 108 MPa at 800 °C, and this signi ﬁcant increase of yield strength at 800 °C may also be associated\nwith the formation of numerous microtwins in 7Al-3.5Ti alloy; In the four experimental alloys, Mo preferentially\npartitions to the γmatrix, the relative content of Al and Ti has a negligible in ﬂuence on the hot deformation\nresistance at 1150 °C, and there is no harmful phase after a heat treatment of 900 °C at 8 h + 750 °C at 12 h.\n1. Introduction\nNovel γ′-strengthened Co –Al–W-base superalloys (Hereinafter re-\nferred to as the novel Co-base superalloys) not only have the high so-\nlidus/liquidus temperatures as well as low solidi ﬁcation segregation,\nbut also show a comparable high-temperature performance with Ni-base superalloys [ 1–3], and the novel Co-base superalloys become one\nof the most promising new generation of high-temperature structuralmaterials. Compared with traditional Ni-base superalloys, the higher\nsolidus temperature and lower γ′solvus temperature of novel Co-base\nsuperalloys bene ﬁt for obtaining larger processing window, which\nmakes it possible to develop the high-performance wrought alloys for\nturbine disks.\nUp to now, researches on novel Co-base superalloys predominantly\nfocused on the e ﬀects of alloying elements on the microstructure and\nmechanical properties in the ternary to hexahydric alloys [ 4–10], and\nstudies focusing on γ′-strengthened multi-component wrought novel\nCo-base superalloys (Hereinafter referred to as the novel wrought Co-\nbase superalloys) are still limited. Neumeier et al. [ 11,12] reported on ahigh-performance novel wrought Co-base superalloy by Cast &Wrought, which showed a larger processing window and achieved si-\nmilar performance compared to Udimet 720Li in terms of high-tem-\nperature strength and oxidation resistance whilst exhibiting a much\nbetter creep resistance at 750 °C.

The ‘cracks’ were repaired by diffusion brazing with\na Ni–Cr–Co–Al–Ta–B filler alloy at 1150°C and then heat treated at 1180°C (HT-A) and 1190°C(HT-B), respectively. A joint with uniform microstructure, chemical composition and hardnesswas obtained using HT-B. The mechanisms of the borides evolution during homogenisation werediscussed. The tensile strength of the HT-B joint tested at 20, 600 and 800°C reached up to approx-\nimately 96, 90 and 87% of the base metal, respectively. The fracture modes of the joints tensile\ntested at various temperatures were discussed.ARTICLE HISTORY\nReceived9February2018\nAccepted7May2018\nKEYWORDS\nSuperalloy;postheattreatment;tensilestrength;microstructure\nIntroduction\nNi-based superalloys are widely applied to hot-section\ncomponents of gas turbine engines such as blades andvanes,duetotheirexcellenthightemperaturestrength,hot corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance [ 1].\nHowever, the components are degrading by thermalfatigue,oxidationandcreepduringservingattheharsh\nconditions.Asthehighcostofmanufacturingnewtur-\nbinecomponents,therepairtechniquesofthesuperal-loyshavealreadyattractedwideattention[ 2–4].Nickel\nsuperalloys, especially those with a high content ofAl and Ti (Al +Ti>6w t - % ) ,h a v ep o o rw e l d a b i l i t y\ndue to their high susceptibility to solidification crack-ing within fusion zone and heat-affected zone (HAZ)during welding or post-weld heat treatment [ 5–8].

All rights reserved.\nKeywords: High-temperature MEMS materials; Chemical vapor deposition; Homogenization/solutionization; Superalloy; Tension test\nThe continued development of microelectronic de-\nvices and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) is\npredicated on the ability of small-scale components to\nwithstand ever-increasing stresses and environmental con-ditions. The vast majority of today’s microdevices are\nmade from polysilicon and other nonmetallic materials,\neven though metallic materials oﬀer a robust balance ofmechanical properties at room temperature. To date, most\nmetallic microcomponents are made using the LIGA pro-\ncess, which involves electrodeposition of Ni into high-as-pect-ratio lithographic molds. Control of the depositionparameters allows for the formation of nanocrystalline\nNi and very high room-temperature strengths, but pure\nelectrodeposited metals like Ni suﬀer from a lack of ther-mal stability, manifest primarily as grain growth [1–8].\nBy contrast, multicomponent, multiphase alloys form the\nbackbone of many conventional Ni-based superalloys thatreside within the hot stages of gas turbine engines where\ntemperatures often exceed 1000 /C176C. Modern Ni-based\nsuperalloys derive their excellent high-temperature proper-ties from the formation of very ﬁne and coherent Ni\n3Alprecipitates, rather than from grain reﬁnement. Further-\nmore, the thermal stability of the c+c0two-phase\nmicrostructure makes them ideal candidates for high-tem-\nperature environments. Unfortunately, conventionalsuperalloy casting and forging technologies do not allow\nfor precision manufacturing of microscale components\nand structures. In the current study, LIGA Ni microtensilespecimens have been subjected to a vapor-phase alumini-\nzation process. Subsequent heat treatments were used to\nevenly distribute Al throughout the Ni microspecimensand to produce the desirable c+c\n0microstructure that is\nfound in commercial Ni-based superalloys.\nLIGA Ni microtensile specimens were manufactured at\nthe Karlsruhe Institute of Technology using their standardX-ray LIGA process [9]. Poly(methyl methacrylate)\n(PMMA) resist was spun onto an Si/Ti/Ti oxide wafer\nand then subjected to an X-ray lithography process witha mask that deﬁned the microtensile geometry.

Therefore, numerical simulation is useful for ﬁnding the most appropriate manufactur-\ning condition prior to experimental trial and error approach. Firstly, we investigated the c0solvus\ntemperature and improved several thermodynamic parameters of the conventional database to obtainreasonable phase boundaries between\nc/g(Ni 3Ti) and c/c0. Based on the new thermodynamic description,\nthe nucleation rates related to temperature histories were calculated by using the CNT with composition\nbalance equation under subsolvus solution treatment. Finally, the multi-phase-ﬁeld method coupledwith the CALPHAD approach and CNT model was applied to the microstructure evolution of intragranular\nsecondary\nc0particles.

Introduction\nA lot of heat-resistant superalloys, such as high temperature\nmaterials applied to the turbine disk of aircraft jet engines or\npower generators, have been developed. TMW-4M3 is one devel-\noped by the National Institute for Material Science in Japan [1].\nThis alloy, a Ni-Co base superalloy, was designed with good phase\nstability and thermal resistance by adding Co and Ti to Alloy 720Li.\nThe nominal compositions of TMW-4M3 and Alloy 720Li are\nshown in Table 1 . Since the Ti composition is higher than that of\nthe alloy 720Li, the amount of c0phase increases, which has a pre-\ncipitation strengthening effect. The maximum volume fraction of c0\nphase is about 50% for TMW-4M3 and 45% for Alloy 720Li.\nFor the practical application of TMW-4M3, we have to control\nthe size and distribution of c0precipitates because they have sig-\nniﬁcant effect on the mechanical properties. However, precipita-tion behavior of c0precipitates in this alloy greatly depends on\nheat treatment conditions [2]as well as Alloy 720Li [3]. After the\nstandard disk making process, we can see three types of c0precip-\nitates, primary c0, secondary c0, and tertiary c0. Primary c0is the\npinning particle of cgrain boundaries. Secondary c0and tertiary\nc0are intragranular precipitates.

GEORGE,\nand MARTIN HEILMAIER\nMultiphase alloys in the Mo-Si-B system are potential high-temperature structural materials due\nto their good oxidation and creep resistance. Since they suﬀer from relatively high densities, thecurrent study focuses on the inﬂuence of density-reducing Ti additions on creep and oxidation\nbehavior at temperatures above 1273 K (1000 /C176C). Two alloys with compositions of\nMo-12.5Si-8.5B-27.5Ti and Mo-9Si-8B-29Ti (in at. pct) were synthesized by arc melting andthen homogenized by annealing in vacuum for 150 hours at 1873 K (1600 /C176C). Both alloys show\nsimilar creep behavior at stresses of 100 to 300 MPa and temperatures of 1473 K and 1573 K\n(1200 /C176C and 1300 /C176C), although they possess diﬀerent intermetallic volume fractions. They\nexhibit superior creep resistance and lower density than a state-of-the-art Ni-base superalloy\n(single-crystalline CMSX-4) as well as other Mo-Si-B alloys. Solid solution strengthening due to\nTi was conﬁrmed by Vickers hardness measurements and is believed to be the reason for thesigniﬁcant increase in creep resistance compared to Mo-Si-B alloys without Ti, but with com-\nparable microstructural length scales. The addition of Ti degrades oxidation resistance relative\nto a Mo-9Si-8B reference alloy due to the formation of a relatively porous duplex layer withtitania matrix enabling easy inward diﬀusion of oxygen.\nDOI: 10.1007/s11661-013-1944-z\n/C211The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International 2013\nI. INTRODUCTION\nINCREASING the eﬃciency of turbines for aero-\nspace and power generation applications by operating\nthem at higher temperatures has been of interest in bothacademia and industry over the past several decades.\nCurrently used Ni-base superalloys are capable of\nfunctioning at temperatures approaching 1423 K(1150 /C176C). As this temperature is close to their melting\npoint, it limits their further development.\n[1]\nAt present, several other metallic systems ( e.g.,\nc¢-strengthened Co-based superalloys,[2]multiphase Nb-\nSi alloys[3,4]) have the potential of operating at temper-\natures higher than Ni-base superalloys. Three-phase Mo-Si-B alloys, consisting of Mo solid solution (bcc) and theintermetallic phases Mo\n3Si (A15) and Mo 5SiB2(T2), are\nalso of interest as new high-temperature structuralmaterials because of their favorable combination of\nproperties such as good oxidation resistance, excellentcreep resistance, and strength at ultrahigh tempera-\ntures.[1,5–8]However, for application in aero-engines,\ncurrent Mo-Si-B alloys suﬀer from one major problem(besides their low room temperature fracture toughness),namely, a relatively high density of around 9.5 g/cm\n3[9]\ncompared to Ni-base superalloys which typically have\ndensities <9 g/cm3.[10]This problem may be solved by\nadditions of light elements such as Ti. However, a high\nconcentration of titanium would be needed to lower the\ndensity of Mo-Si-B alloys substantially. Also, its impacton mechanical properties and oxidation resistance is\nlikely to be signiﬁcant, since Ti is soluble in both Mo and\nits several silicide phases.[11]As an example, Sakidja\net al.[12]prepared Mo-20Si-10B-50Ti and Mo-20Si-10B-\n35Ti alloys (all concentrations in this paper are in at. pct if\nnot stated otherwise) by arc melting and conﬁrmed thatdensities were reduced to 6.5 and 7.6 g/cm3, respectively.\nHowever, the mechanical and oxidatio"

INTRODUCTION\nNICKEL -BASE superalloys derive their excellent\nmechanical properties at high temperatures from strength-\nening by a cuboidal and coherently embedded L1 2*p h a s e\nwithin an A1 (see footnote *) matrix phase. In 2006,\nresearchers working with K. Ishida[1]found a new\nternary L1 2phase in the Co-Al-W system. This\ndiscovery has generated renewed interest in the devel-\nopment of c0-strengthened cobalt-base superalloys\nworldwide.[2–7]A year later, Chinen and co-workers\nreported the discovery of another L1 2phase,\nCo3(Ge,W).[8]They found that the c0-solvus tempera-\nture of this phase in a Co-11.0Ge-5.7W alloy is 1180 K\n(907 /C176C), which is lower than that of Co 3(Al,W) at\n1263 K (990 /C176C). This ﬁnding implies that the addition\nof Ge to alloys based on the Co-Al-W system maylower the c0-solvus temperature, thereby potentially\nenlarging the processing window and increasing the\nease with which wrought alloys could be forged.\nGermanium can be used as a melting point depressant\nin brazes for Ni-base superalloy single crystals.[9]Such\nbrazes allow epitaxial single-crystal joints to be pro-\nduced by an isothermal heat treatment. Importantly, Ge\nforms Ni 3Ge precipitates that are isomorphous to the\nNi3Al-based precipitates of Ni-base superalloys. This\nenables these brazes to avoid the deleterious, brittle\nphases produced with boron-based brazes.[10]However,\nthe mechanical properties, c=c0lattice misﬁt, and\nmicrostructural evolution during creep have been\nobserved to change in the brazing-aﬀected zone com-\npared to the base material.[11]\nIf new Co-base A1-L1 2superalloys are successfully\nrealized, Co-Ge brazes oﬀer a method by which\nrepair and joining operations may be performed.\nSuch technologies will poten tially improve the eco-\nnomic case for Co-based A1-L1 2superalloys and\nallow them to be considered for a wider range of\napplications.\nTo understand the potential for Co-Ge brazes, it is\nnecessary to know the properties of alloys intermediate\nbetween Co-Al-W and Co-Ge-W, and this is the aim of\nthe present study. Speciﬁcally, it is important to acquire\ndata on phase equilibria and transformation tempera-\ntures in Co-Al-Ge-W alloys. Brazing would only be\nfeasible if the liquidus temperature of a braze alloy is\nsuﬃciently low, i.e., lower than the solidus temperature\nof the alloy that is to be processed. Additionally, it is\ndesirable that c0-strengthening is also possible in the\nbraze alloy and that this c=c0"

Introduction\nThe development of Ni-based superalloy has led to the single\ncrystal superalloy as its process went through from equiaxed crys-\ntal structure to columnar crystal structure. Single crystal superal-\nloy has been especially known to have excellent oxidation and\ncorrosion resistance as well as superb creep and fatigue character-\nistic. Because of such features, the signal crystal superalloy has\nbeen applied to hot section components such as blades and vanes\nin gas turbines for improving their efﬁciency.\nThe single crystal superalloy has evolved continuously since\n1980s. For the ﬁrst generation of single crystal superalloy such as\nPWA1480, Rene N4 and SRR99, the contents of Al, Ti, and Ta whichconsist of\nc0phase increased, while intergranular reinforcing ele-\nments C and B, which have been added to the existing columnar\ncrystal structure, were removed. The second generation single\ncrystal superalloys such as PWA1484, CMSX-4 and ReneN5 is char-\nacterized by most of them containing 3 wt.% of Re, while that of the\nthird generation such as CMSX-10 and Rene N6 contains Re up to\n6 wt.% [1–3] . General trend of the development of the single crystal\nsuperalloy has been decreasing the contents of Cr and increasing\nthe contents of Al and Re while maintaining the contents of Ti\nand Mo at the same level compared to the existing alloys. The\nfourth generation alloy such as MC-NG, EPM-102 and TMS-162\ncontaining Ru has been under development since 2000 [4,5] .CMSX-4 is a representative of commercialized single crystal\nsuperalloy and is being used as hot section components of gas tur-\nbine blades and vanes [6]. SX MK4HC has been also applied to gas\nturbines of power plants, and the small angle grain boundary rein-\nforcement elements such as C, B and Hf have been added to CMSX-\n4[7].\nIt is extremely challenging to produce defect-free gas turbine\nblades for power plants because it is relative bigger and more com-\nplex than the ones used in aircrafts.

GABB\nPlastic ﬂow and microstructure evolution during sub- and supersolvus forging and subsequent\nsupersolvus heat treatment of the powder-metallurgy superalloy LSHR (low-solvus, high-refractory) were investigated to develop an understanding of methods that can be used to obtain\na moderately coarse gamma grain size under well-controlled conditions. To this end, isothermal,\nhot compression tests were conducted over broad ranges of temperature [(1144 K to 1450 K)871/C176C to 1177 /C176C] and constant true strain rate (0.0005 to 10 s\n/C01). At low temperatures,\ndeformation was generally characterized by ﬂow softening and dynamic recrystallization that led\nto a decrease in grain size. At high subsolvus temperatures and low strain rates, steady-state ﬂowor ﬂow hardening was observed. These latter behaviors were ascribed to superplastic deforma-\ntion and microstructure evolution characterized by a constant grain size or concomitant dynamic\ngrain growth, respectively. During supersolvus heat treatment following subsolvus deformation,increases in grain size whose magnitude was a function of the prior deformation conditions were\nnoted. A transition in ﬂow behavior from superplastic to nonsuperplastic and the development\nduring forging at a high subsolvus temperature of a wide (possibly bi- or multimodal) gamma-grain-size distribution having some large grains led to a substantially coarser grain size duringsupersolvus annealing in comparison to that produced under all other forging conditions.\nDOI: 10.1007/s11661-013-1675-1\n/C211The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International 2013\nI. INTRODUCTION\nNICKEL -BASE superalloys required for high-tem-\nperature applications in the aerospace and power-generation industries are frequently made by powder-\nmetallurgy (PM) or directional solidiﬁcation (DS)\napproaches.[1]The PM method is the most commonly\nused for rotating components that require high tensileand fatigue strength and a modicum of resistance to\ncreep at temperatures of the order of 925 K (652 /C176C).\nPre-alloyed superalloy powders are usually made by\nspray atomization and are consolidated by hot isostatic\npressing (HIP) or blind-die compaction followed by hot\nextrusion. PM billets so produced have a relatively ﬁnegamma grain size ( ~5 microns) and a uniform distribution\nof second-phase precipitates such as gamma prime. Atelevated processing temperatures, this microstructure\nyields low ﬂow stress and high strain rate sensitivity\ntypical of superplastic ﬂow and is therefore useful in partfabrication viaclosed-die, isothermal forging. To improve\nthe resistance to creep and creep-crack growth under\ndwell-fatigue loading in service, ﬁnal heat treatment abovethe solvus temperature of the strengthening precipitates is\noften conducted to increase the gamma grain size to values\nof the order of 50 lm. Such ﬁnishing operations are\nusually applied uniformly to a component, but can also beapplied locally for those regions of a component which\nexperience the highest temperatures, thus forming the\nbasis for dual-microstructure heat treatments.\n[2–6]\nA number of prior investigations have been conducted\nto establish the eﬀect of thermomechanical processing\nvariables on plastic ﬂow and microstructure evolution inPM nickel-base superalloys.

The γ′ volume fraction, size and lattice misfit were seen \nto increase with a larger Al:Nb ratio, although these changes resulted in reduced hardness. The change in the \ncritical resolved shear stress (CRSS) associated with strong dislocation coupling was determined to be the \ndominant strengthening mechanism and increased with decreasing Al:Nb ratio.

Engine performance can be enhanced through \nan increase in the temperature at which the engi nes are operated or, alternatively, through higher \nrotational speeds. However, current nickel-base superalloys, used in the hottest sections of the engine, \nare working close to their physical limits and are unable to tolerate any further increase in temperature \nor stress [3]. The development of new nickel-bas e superalloys specifically designed to operate under \nmore demanding conditions is therefore critical to the ongoing advancement of gas turbine engines. \nNickel-base superalloys typically consist of an A1 (strukturbericht notation) matrix ( γ) solid solution, \nreinforced with a distribution of coherent Ni 3Al, L1 2 superlattice precipitates ( γ′).

After \nhomogenizing at a high -temperature, followed by fast or slow cooling to room temperature, this \nalloy exhibited a nano -scale mixture of co -continuous BCC and B2 phases, resembling a \nspinodally decomposed microstructure with concurrent ordering.

The microstructure of this HEA resembles that of advanced superalloys with a high entropy FCC matrix and L1\n2 ordered precipitates, so it is also named as “high entropy superalloy (HESA)”. The \ntensile yield strengths of HESA surpass those of the reported HEAs from room temperature to elevated temperatures; furthermore, its creep resistance at 982 °C can be compared to those of some Ni-based \nsuperalloys. Analysis on experimental results indicate that HESA could be strengthened by the low stacking-fault energy of the matrix, high anti-phase boundary energy of the strengthening precipitate, and thermally stable microstructure. Positive misfit between FCC matrix and precipitate has yielded parallel raft microstructure during creep at 982 °C, and the creep curves of HESA were dominated by \ntertiary creep behavior. To the best of authors’ knowledge, this article is the first to present the elevated temperature tensile creep study on full scale specimens of a high entropy alloy, and the potential of HESA for high temperature structural application is discussed.\nThe concept of high entropy alloys (HEAs) has allowed the exploration of large composition space of alloys, and \nis currently one of the most intriguing research topics in the field of materials science\n1–3. Recent studies have \nshown attractive mechanical properties of HEAs at cryogenic temperature4 and room temperature5 with excellent \ncombinations of high strength and toughness, indicating their potential as the structural materials. However, the strength of single phase type HEAs were reported to be insufficient at elevated temperatures\n6. Several HEAs, such \nas CoCrFeNiNbx7 and CoCrFeNiMox8 demonstrated that a moderate increase in tensile strength can be achieved \nby various precipitates. As a result, precipitation strengthening should be considered in developing HEAs for high temperature applications. The physical metallurgy of superalloys\n9 have been employed to design HEAs by \nutilization of significant volume fractions of stable and coherent L12 γ′ to provide high temperature strength, e.g., \nAl10Co25Cr8Fe15Ni36Ti6 HEA was designed to contain 46 vol% of γ′ precipitates10, and its tensile strength could \nsurpass those of Inconel 617 and Alloy 800 H. Nevertheless, the γ′ solvus temperatures of the reported γ′-bearing \nHEAs still remained relatively low comparing to those of superalloys9. Furthermore, there were phase instability \nassociated with the formation of L21 Ni2AlTi, B2, and Cu-rich FCC5,11,12. Therefore, the development for precipi-\ntation strengthened HEAs is only at the incipient stage, and more research efforts will be required.\nIn present study, the high temperature tensile and creep behaviors of a novel alloy named high entropy \nsuperalloy (HESA)13 have been investigated. HESA is strengthened by the coherent L12 γ′ precipitates, while \nthe FCC matrix remains high entropy (ΔSmix > 1.5 R)14. For example, the composition of HESA in current study \nis Ni47.9Al10.2Co16.9Cr7.4Fe8.9Ti5.8Mo0.9Nb1.2W0.4C0.4 (at%), so the calculated Δ Smix is 1.60 R, which is higher than \nthose of conventional superalloys such as CM247LC (Δ Smix = 1.29 R), Rene′  N5 (Δ Smix = 1.22 R), and CMSX-2 \n(ΔSmix = "

For this purpose, three lots of LSHRwith varying initial carbon/boron composition and thermomechanical history were subjected to a\nseries of short-time (induction) and long-time (furnace) heat treatments followed by scanning\nelectron microscopy/electron backscatter diﬀraction and quantitative metallography. The size ofthe (pinned) gamma grains exhibited a limited dependence on heating rate and soak time at peaktemperature, and it was generally smaller than the predictions based on the classic Smith-Zener\nmodel. The diﬀerences were rationalized in terms of stereological and pinning-particle location\neﬀects.

INTRODUCTION\nNICKEL -BASE superalloys are important materials\nfor high-temperature applications such as those in theaerospace and power-generation industries. Typically,\nthey are manufactured by one of two routes involving\ninitial alloy synthesis via an ingot metallurgy (IM) or apowder metallurgy (PM) technique.\n[1,2]The ﬁrst\napproach comprises the melting and solidiﬁcation of\ningots, homogenization to reduce microsegregation, anda number of thermomechanical processing steps to\nbreak down the coarse cast microstructure to obtain a\nuniform, recrystallized structure of gamma grains. Thegrain size of fully wrought IM superalloys is typically ofthe order of 50 lm. More highly alloyed materials are\nprone to macrosegregation and hence are fabricated by\nPM methods. Usually, powders are consolidated by hotisostatic pressing (HIP) or blind-die compaction fol-\nlowed by hot extrusion. PM billets so produced have amuch ﬁner grain size ( ~5lm) and a uniform distribution\nof second-phase precipitates such as gamma prime. At\nelevated processing temperatures, this microstructure\nyields low ﬂow stress and high rate sensitivity typical ofsuperplastic ﬂow and, therefore, is useful in part\nfabrication via closed-die, isothermal forging.\nThe ﬁnal heat treatment of isothermally forged PM\nsuperalloy components consists of heat treatment eitherbelow or above the solution temperature (solvus) for the\nstrengthening precipitates. Subsolvus heat treatment\nresults in the retention of a ﬁne gamma grain size givingoptimal strength and resistance to fatigue-crack initia-\ntion. Solution treatment above the solvus gives rise to a\ncoarser gamma grain size ( ~30 to 50 lm) which is\nattractive with respect to creep and low-cycle fatigue\n(dwell crack-growth) properties. Unfortunately, PM\nnickel-base superalloys can be prone to the growth ofabnormally large grains (several hundred microns in size\nor greater) when subjected to supersolvus heat treat-\nment. For this reason, extensive experimentation hasbeen conducted to establish processing routes andcomposition modiﬁcations that may limit the suscepti-\nbility to such defects. For example, the eﬃcacy of\nprocessing routes that impose limits on the strain rateduring isothermal forging (to maintain superplastic\nconditions) and the control "

LOCQ, M. MARTIN, C. RAMUSAT, F. FOSSARD, and M. PERRUT\nA Co-Ni-based alloy strengthened by c¢-(L1 2) precipitates was utilized to investigate the\nprecipitation evolution after various cooling rates and several aging conditions. In this study,\nthe precipitate size and volume fraction have been studied viascanning electron microscopy and\ntransmission electron microscopy. The inﬂuence of the precipitation evolution was measured via\nmicrohardness tests. The cooling rate study shows a more sluggish c¢precipitation reaction\ncompared to that observed in a Ni-based superalloy. Following a rapid cooling rate, the\napplication of appropriate double aging treatments allows for the increase of the c¢volume\nfraction as well as the control of the size and distribution of the precipitates. The highest\nhardness values reach those measured on supersolvus cast and wrought Ni-based superalloys.\nThe observed c¢precipitation behavior should have implications for the production, the heat\ntreatment, the welding, or the additive manufacturing of this new class of high-temperature\nmaterials.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s11661-018-4689-x\n/C211The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International 2018\nI. INTRODUCTION\nTHEmechanical properties and especially the tensile\nstrength of c/c¢superalloys strongly depend on the\nfraction, distribution, and size of the c¢-phase precipitates.\nRegarding high c¢fraction wrought Ni-based superalloys,\nthec¢precipitation is predominantly controlled by the\ncooling rate[1–5]after the solutioning heat treatment. In\ngeneral, one or two aging treatments are then applied to\nadjust the c¢precipitate characteristics.[6–8]\nRecently, several research teams have found that\nCo-based alloys can possibly be strengthened by the\nprecipitation of a L1 2-c¢phase based on Co 3(Al,W).\nThis new phase is the subject of numerous studies since\nthe article of Sato et al .[9]More recently, Indian\nresearchers published a series of articles on Co-based\nalloys strengthened by the precipitation of the Co 3(Al,\nMo,X) phase (where Xis Ta or Nb).[10–14]Even more\nrecently, a novel Co-Ti-Cr alloy was shown to be\nstrengthened by c¢precipitates.[15]All these results have\nattracted great attention of several research groups.\nMost of the studies on Co-Al-W alloys are dedicated to\nthe improvement of their mechanical properties and\nenvironmental resistance by means of alloying in rela-\ntion to the microstructure. Only few studies focused onthec¢-Co 3(Al,W)-phase precipitation and more precisely\non the coarsening behavior.[16–21]\nThe current study was performed on a Co-Ni-based\nalloy, the composition of which was derived from that of\na quaternary model alloy studied by Shinagawa et al.[22]\nThe Ni substitution for Co promotes the widening of the\nc/c¢domain, the increase of the c¢solvus temperature,\nand the decrease of the lattice parameter mismatch\nbetween the candc¢phases.\nThe objective of the present study was to investigate\nthe mechanisms of the c¢precipitation under various\nheat treatments. We ﬁrst studied the inﬂuence of the\ncooling rate on the c¢precipitation, and the results were\ncompared to those obtained jointly on a Ni-based\nsuperalloy. Second, we investigated the eﬀects of three\naging parameters to optimize the c¢precipitation and\nconsequently the strength of this Co-Ni-based alloy.\nII.

INTRODUCTION\nTHErecent report of a c¢-strengthened Co-Al-W-\nbased alloy opened up a practical possibility for\ndeveloping new Co-based superalloys, which havebecome an increasingly active research area over the\npast decade.[1–13]After studying their potentials, it was\nfound that the solvus temperature of c¢precipitates can\nbe increased up to 1200 /C176C with high solidus tempera-\nture,[2–5]mechanical performance[6–8]and oxidation\nproperties[9–13]as promising engineering materials can-\ndidate for high-temperature applications. However,their high density and limited microstructural stability\nremain the biggest challenges for their further\ndevelopment.\nSpecial eﬀorts have been devoted to reducing or\nreplacing the content of dense but essential c¢-former\nelement W. Some work studied the inﬂuence of alloyingelements on the density and microstructural stability of\nCo-based superalloys.\n[5,14–20]Neumeier et al .[21]andKnop et al.[22]reported Co-based superalloys with better\nhigh-temperature strength than most of polycrystallineNi-based superalloys, but the density is as high as 8.8and 8.52 g/cm\n3. As a result, variant alloy systems with\nlow or zero W content have been investigated, develop-\ning alloys based on Co-Al-Mo,[23,24]Co-Ge-W,[25,26]\nCo-Ti-Cr,[27]Co-Ti-V,[28]Co-Nb-V,[29]and so on.\nAccordingly, the density has been decreased from 9.5\nto 8.5 g/cm3, close to those of most commercial\nNi-based and Co-based polycrystalline alloys. Among\nthese FCC-L1 2variants, Co-Al-Mo- and Co-N-\nb-V-based alloys[23,24,29]are mostly investigated; how-\never, in some cases, undesired secondary phases wereformed and harmful to the high-temperature mechanical\nperformance. This was especially true when Cr was\nadded to increase the oxidation resistance but furthernarrow the c¢phase ﬁeld, even when high NI content\nwas added to enlarge the c-c¢two-phase ﬁeld and\nmicrostructural stability.\nIn this study, the alloys with intermediate composi-\ntions between systems based on Co-Al-W, Co-Al-Mo\nand Co-Al-Nb have been studied with the presence ofhigh Cr (12 at. pct) and Ni (30 at. pct) content. The\ndensity, phase transformation temperatures, c-c¢two-\nphase microstructure, long-term microstructural stabil-ity and ﬂow stresses at intermediate temperature areexamined to understand their change when the W\ncontent is replaced by an equal amount of Mo or Nb.\nThis study will provide insights into the development oflow-density, high-strength Co-based superalloys for\nintermediate temperature applications.\n HUADONG FU"

Insufﬁcient holding time for complete isothermal solidiﬁcation of liquated insert caused formation of eutectic-typemicroconstituent along the joint centerline region in the alloy. In agreement with prediction by conventional TLP diffusion models, an increasein bonding temperature for a constant gap size, resulted in decrease in the time, t\nf,required to form a eutectic-free joint by complete isothermal\nsolidiﬁcation. However, a signiﬁcant deviation from these models was observed in specimens bonded at and above 1175◦C. A reduction in\nisothermal solidiﬁcation rate with increased temperature was observed in these specimens, such that a eutectic-free joint could not be achieved byholding for a time period that produced complete isothermal solidiﬁcation at lower temperatures. Boron-rich particles were observed within theeutectic that formed in the joints prepared at the higher temperatures. An overriding effect of decrease in boron solubility relative to increase in i ts\ndiffusivity with increase in temperature, is a plausible important factor responsible for the reduction in isothermal solidiﬁcation rate at the hig her\nbonding temperatures.© 2007 Elsevier B.V .

Introduction\nHeat resistant nickel base superalloys are used for manufac-\nturing hot section components of aero and land-based gas turbineengines, due to their remarkable high temperature mechanicalproperties and hot corrosion resistance. Exposure to harsh oper-ating conditions often causes these components to be damagedby cracking and surface erosion during service. It is usuallymore economically attractive to repair damaged parts insteadof a complete replacement. Traditional repair techniques, suchas welding are commonly used in the repair of many superalloycomponents. However, precipitation hardened nickel base super-alloys, like Waspaloy, containing relatively high amounts of Aland Ti are generally considered to be difﬁcult to weld due to theirhigh susceptibility to heat-affected zone (HAZ) cracking [1,2] .\nAs a result, a process known as transient liquid phase (TLP)bonding [3], has evolved as an attractive alternate joining tech-\n∗Corresponding author.

The major advantage of this tech-nique over conventional brazing is that the process can achievejoints free of eutectic-type microconstituents that are usuallydetrimental to mechanical properties. Nevertheless, optimiza-tion of the process variables that control the bond microstructureis vital in achieving eutectic-free joint. A number of studies [4–8]\nhave been previously done to model microstructural develop-ment during TLP bonding. These studies normally model theisothermal solidiﬁcation stage of the process using a binaryphase relationship between the base and ﬁller alloy.

Introduction\nNi-base superalloys are hardened by γ΄precipitates that dis-\ntributed uniformly in the γmatrix. The former has an ordered L1 2\nstructure, while the latter is a disordered fcc phase [1]. This unique\nγ/γ΄two-phase structure enables Ni-base superalloys to have\nexcellent mechanical properties at high temperatures. Therefore,\ncommercial hot gas path components, for example, turbine blades,\ndiscs and nozzle guide vanes, in aero-engines and industrial (land-\nbase) gas turbines, are made of Ni-base superalloys. For the\nmechanical performance of Ni-base superalloys, the γ΄precipitate\nsize, distribution and volume fraction are of great importance.\nThus, a great deal of research has been devoted to the γ΄\nprecipitation [2–10]. In order to optimize the process of γ΄\nprecipitation, the hot working parameters and heat treatments\nhave to be extensively explored [11–14] for a speci ﬁc disc alloy.\nIn contrast, only few studies paid attention to the γprecipitation\nwithin γ΄phase and its associated e ffects on deformation [15–19],\nwhich is indispensable to fully understand the microstructure stability\nand mechanical behaviors of superalloys. The primary γ΄is generally\nretained to pin the grain boundary during annealing heat treatment\nand control the grain size of disc superalloys. Undoubtedly, the\ndeformation behavior of primary γ΄affects the mechanical perfor-\nmance of superalloys. It was reported that intergranular damage\ninitiated at primary γ΄interfaces might degrade the alloy [20].TMW-4M3 is a new promising Ni –Co-base disc superalloy\ndeveloped at National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS),\nJapan. This new alloy can be prepared by cast and wrought\nprocessing and exhibits good overall mechanical properties at\ntemperatures in excess of 700 1C[21]. Typical tri-modal distribu-\ntion of γ΄precipitates, i.e. primary, secondary and tertiary γ΄, has\nbeen attained in TMW-4M3 when subsolvus heat treatment is\nemployed [22]. Our results show that the volume fraction of\nprimary γ΄is more than 10% if TMW-4M3 is solution treated in\nthe temperature range of 1100 –1130 1C followed by two steps\naging treatment [23].\nIn the present study, the γprecipitation in the primary γ΄of\nTMW-4M3 has been investigated.

GO ¨KEN\nA set of advanced single crystalline c¢strengthened Co-base superalloys with at least nine\nalloying elements (Co, Ni, Al, W, Ti, Ta, Cr, Si, Hf, Re) has been developed and investigated.\nThe objective was to generate multinary Co-base superalloys with signiﬁcantly improved\nproperties compared to the original Co-Al-W-based alloys. All alloys show the typical c/c¢\ntwo-phase microstructure. A c¢solvus temperature up to 1174 /C176C and c¢volume fractions\nbetween 40 and 60 pct at 1050 /C176C could be achieved, which is signiﬁcantly higher compared to\nmost other Co-Al-W-based superalloys. However, higher contents of Ti, Ta, and the addition of\nRe decrease the long-term stability. Atom probe tomography revealed that Re does not\npartition to the cphase as strongly as in Ni-base superalloys. Compression creep properties were\ninvestigated at 1050 /C176C and 125 MPa in h001idirection. The creep resistance is close to that of\nﬁrst generation Ni-base superalloys. The creep mechanisms of the Re-containing alloy was\nfurther investigated and it was found that the deformation is located preferentially in the c\nchannels although some precipitates are sheared during early stages of creep. The addition of Re\ndid not improve the mechanical properties and is therefore not considered as a crucial element in\nthe design of future Co-base superalloys for high temperature applications. Thermodynamic\ncalculations describe well how the alloying elements inﬂuence the transformation temperatures\nalthough there is still an oﬀset in the actual values. Furthermore, a full set of elastic constants of\none of the multinary alloys is presented, showing increased elastic stiﬀness leading to a higher\nYoung’s modulus for the investigated alloy, compared to conventional Ni-base superalloys. The\noxidation resistance is signiﬁcantly improved compared to the ternary Co-Al-W compound.

CHATURVEDI\nThe eﬀect of preweld overaging heat treatment on the microstructural response in the heat-\naﬀected zone (HAZ) of a precipitation-hardened nickel-base superalloy INCONEL 738LCsubjected to the welding thermal cycle ( i.e., rapid) was investigated. The overaging heat treat-\nment resulted in the formation of an interfacial microconstituent containing M\n23X6particles\nand coarsening of primary and secondary c¢precipitates. The HAZ microstructures around\nwelds in the overaged alloy were simulated using the Gleeble thermomechanical simulation\nsystem. Microstructural examination of simulated HAZs and those present in tungsten inert gas\n(TIG) welded specimens showed the occurrence of extensive grain boundary liquation involvingliquation reaction of the interfacial microconstituents containing M\n23X6particles and MC-type\ncarbides. In addition, the coarsened c¢precipitate particles present in the overaged alloy per-\nsisted well above their solvus temperature to temperatures where they constitutionally liquatedand contributed to considerable liquation of grain boundaries, during continuous rapid heating.\nIntergranular HAZ microﬁssuring, with resolidiﬁed product formed mostly on one side of the\nmicroﬁssures, was observed in welded specimens. This suggested that the HAZ microﬁssuringgenerally occurred by decohesion across one of the solid-liquid interfaces during the grainboundary liquation stage of the weld thermal cycle. Correlation of simulated HAZ micro-\nstructures with hot ductility properties of the alloy revealed that the temperature at which the\nalloy exhibited zero ductility during heating was within the temperature range at which grainboundary liquation was observed. The on-cooling ductility of the alloy was signiﬁcantly dam-\naged by the on-heating liquation reaction, as reﬂected by the considerably low ductility recovery\ntemperature (DRT). Important characteristics of the intergranular liquid that could inﬂuenceHAZ microﬁssuring of the alloy in overaged condition are also discussed.\nDOI: 10.1007/s11661-006-9025-1\n/C211The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International 2007\nI. INTRODUCTION\nGASturbines are generally designed within the limits\nof current technology for the best possible eﬃciencies\nand output, and as such, complex shaped parts made of\nnickel-base superalloys are often required to withstandthe stringent demands encountered in aero engines and\npower generation turbines. INCONEL* 738 superalloy\nis one of the most widely used hot-corrosion-resistant\nsuperalloys in both land-based and aero gas turbine\nengines. In addition to its remarkable hot corrosion/oxidation resistance, this superalloy also exhibits\nexcellent high-temperature strength primarily due to\nprecipitation hardening by the ordered intermetallicNi\n3(Al,Ti)- c¢phase. The weldability of heat-resistant\nnickel-base superalloys has gained importance because\nof the wide use of welding to fabricate and repairservice-damaged hot section components of gas tur-bines. Unfortunately, application of fusion welding to\nfabrication and repair of precipitation-hardened nickel-\nbase superalloys such as IN 738 has been severelyrestricted. This is because these alloys, especially those\ncontaining a substantial amount of Al and Ti (> 6 wt\npct), are highly susceptible to microﬁssuring predomi-nantly in the heat-aﬀected zone (HAZ) during welding\nand postweld heat treatment (PWHT).\n[1]The HAZ\nmicroﬁssuring susceptibility is known to depend uponthe"

The disordered bcc A2 and ordered B2 phases are also modelled with a single equation. The \nexistence of vacancies as defects in this structure is described. The other phases are modelled as substitu- \ntional solutions, or as stoichiometric or non-stroichiometric binary compounds. The present assessment is \nlimited to the sub-system A1Ni-Cr-Ni where no ternary phase exists. The parameters describing the Gibbs \nenergy of all the assessed phases are given. Extensive comparisons between calculation and experimental \ndata are presented. \nIntroduction \nThe mechanical properties of the Ni base superalloys are mainly due to the coherency between their \nconstituting phases 9' (A1) and 7' (L12), the L12 structure being an ordered state of the fcc (A1) lattice. \nThe thermodynamic behaviour of both phases can thus be modelled by a single Gibbs energy function \nwhich is a sum of two contributions, one corresponding to the Gibbs energy of the disordered phase and \nthe other to the ordering Gibbs energy. This approach leads to constraints between the thermodynamic \nparameters to ensure the ability of the ordered phase to disorder. \nFor Ni base superalloys, the ternary system AI-Cr-Ni is an important sub-system. The present \nassessment of this system is a revision of the one presented in Dupin's thesis [95Dup]. It is part of a \nwider project dedicated to the constitution of a multicomponent thermodynamic database for Ni base \nsuperalloys [01Dup]. It introduces a new modelling for the A2 and B2 phases, using also for both of them \na single Gibbs energy function and takes into account new experimental liquidus temperatures. \nAn assessment of this ternary system has recently been published by Huang and Chang [99Hua]. \nIt differs mainly from Dupin's thesis work [95Dup] in the modelling of the 7' phase. Arguing that \"the \ndescription by Dupin seems to be unnecessarily complicated\", the two fcc phases 7 and 7' are modelled \nseparetely. The formalism that they used is actually identical to Dupin's but when the ~,' phase disorders, \na disordered phases different of the stable 7 is obtained. No real simplification is thus introduced by Huang \nand Chang's contribution, the fewer number of parameters used for the ordering contribution being largely \ncompensated by the number of the parameters of the new disordered state. Moreover, in multicomponent \nsystems, a possible competition between stable and metastable disordered phases may occur. \nIn the present analysis of the A1-Cr-Ni system, the approach introduced by Ansara et al. [88Ansi \nis applied not only to the 9' and 7' phases but also to the A2 and B2 phases. It has initially been \nused by Lacaze and Sundman [91Lac] in the Fe-Si system for the A2 and B2 phases undergoing a sec- \nond order transformation.

REED\nThe mechanical behavior of a new single-crystal nickel-based superalloy for industrial gas\nturbine (IGT) applications is studied under creep and out-of-phase (OP) thermomechanical\nfatigue (TMF) conditions. Neutron diﬀraction methods and thermodynamic modeling are usedto quantify the variation of the gamma prime ( c¢) strengthening phase around the c¢solvus\ntemperature; these aid the design of primary aging heat treatments to develop either uniform or\nbimodal microstructures of the c¢phase. Under creep conditions in the temperature range\n1023 K to 1123 K (750 /C176C to 850 /C176C), with stresses between 235 to 520 MPa, the creep per-\nformance is best with a ﬁner and uniform c¢microstructure. On the other hand, the OP TMF\nperformance improves when the c¢precipitate size is larger. Thus, the micromechanical degra-\ndation mechanisms occurring during creep and TMF are distinct. During TMF, localized shearbanding occurs with the c¢phase penetrated by dislocations; however, during creep, the dislo-\ncation activity is restricted to the matrix phase. The factors controlling TMF resistance are\nrationalized.\nDOI: 10.1007/s11661-011-0995-2\n/C211The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International 2012\nI. INTRODUCTION\nNEWnickel-based superalloys[1,2]are needed for hot\nsection components, e.g., turbine blades and guide\nvanes, in the next-generation gas turbine enginesrequired for power generation applications. Signiﬁcant\ndemands will be placed on these materials. For instance,\nexcellent resistance to environmental attack is required,since the operating conditions and fuels used for theseapplications induce oxidation and corrosion; thus, the\nsuperalloys used will be distinct from those currently\nemployed for aeroengine applications. Moreover, theymust withstand the large mechanical loads necessary for\neﬃcient extraction of mechanical energy from the hot\ngas stream. Hence, creep\n[1,2]and fatigue[3,4]must be\nresisted. Recently, a new grade of single-crystal super-\nalloy was developed for such applications, which dis-\nplays a good balance of environmental and mechanicalproperties.[5,6]Its Cr content (at 15 wt pct) is substan-\ntially greater than for existing single-crystal superalloys,\nwhich improves signiﬁcantly the resistance to oxidation\nand corrosion.[7]\nThis article is concerned with the mechanical perfor-\nmance of this new single crystal superalloy. In common\nwith most precipitation-hardened systems, the proper-ties displayed will depend in a sensitive fashion upon the\nmicrostructure developed during heat treatment; for this\nclass of material, hardening is by the gamma prime ( c¢)\nphase and thus conditioning of the microstructure at\ntemperatures in and around the c¢solvus is expected to\ninﬂuence the mechanical properties displayed. Twodistinct forms of mechanical response are studied as a\nfunction of the heat treatment applied: ﬁrst, creep\ndeformation, which is important due to the centrifugalloading experienced by the turbine blades in the\nengine;\n[1,2]and, second, thermomechanical fatigue\n(TMF), which is relevant particularly for smaller (aero-derivative) industrial gas turbines (IGTs) because of theinteraction of thermal and mechanical strains arising\nfrom engine startup/cooldown.\n[8,9]As mission require-\nments become more demanding, it is becoming apparentthat the performance of the material under TMF\nconditions can be life limiting; however, historically,\nvery much more a"

As a result, thermal proc essing parameters are carefully selected 14 \nto control precipitate populations in an effort to modify specific microstructural features 15 \nthat can impact resulting properties. The present i nvestigation reports on how a stepped 16 \ncooling rate was able to modify the microstructure of two experimental Ni-base 17 \nsuperalloys. Cooling rates of 0.1˚C/s and 0.01˚C/s were maintained through the γ′ solvus 18 \ntemperature to a transition temperature ~10˚C to 15 ˚C below the solvus. Following the 19 \ntransition temperature, a controlled cooling rate o f 1˚C/s was applied to control the size 20 \nand distribution of the secondary γ′ precipitates. For both experimental alloys, slow 21 \ncooling rates through the γ′ solvus temperature resulted in the formation of co arse grain 22 \nboundary precipitates while secondary γ′ precipitates formed upon the subsequent faster 23 \ncooling rate of 1˚C/s. Coarse grain boundary γ′ precipitates resulted in higher amplitudes 24 \nand wavelengths of serration along the boundary. In  addition to cooling rate, the grain 25 \nboundary misorientation was also found to influence  the precipitation of grain boundary 26 \nγ′ with larger precipitate populations found along hi gh angle grain boundaries. Results 27 \nfrom this study appear to support the concept that meso-scale engineering of grain 28 \nboundary structures may potentially be used to enha nce and optimize the high 29 \ntemperature properties of Ni-base superalloys. 30 \n 31 \n 32 \n1.

Introduction\nIncreased  turbine  entry  temperatures  (TET)  for  improved  tur-\nbine efﬁciency  push  Ni-base  superalloys  to  their  operational  limits.\nTo  meet  the  demands  of  increased  TET,  a  new  generation  of  Ni-base\nsuperalloys  are  now  being  produced  through  powder  metallurgy\n(P/M).  In  2006,  a  new  Co-base  alloy  family  was  reported  with\nstrength  similar  to  Ni-base  superalloys  [1].  Sato  et  al.  discovered\nthat  the  Co–Al–W  ternary  system  contains  a  L12/CR/primephase,  identi-\nﬁed  as  Co3(Al,W).  The  development  of  these  alloys  is  motivated  by\ntheir  potential  for  (i)  improved  creep  behaviour  due  to  reduced  /CR/prime\ncoarsening  arising  from  the  low  diffusivity  of  W  in  the  matrix,  (ii)\nreduced  freezing  range  and  therefore  enhanced  castability  [2]  and\n(iii)  potential  for  higher  stacking  fault  energies  than  in  Ni,  and  hence\nimproved  creep  strengths  [3–5] .  Ta  additions  have  been  investi-\ngated  [1,6–9] ,  ﬁnding  that  it  is  effective  for  stabilisation  of  the  /CR/prime\nphase,  increasing  the  solvus  temperature  [10,11] .  Higher  temper-\natures  require  excellent  environmental  degradation  resistance  in\noxidising  environments  to  meet  the  operational  service  life  of  the\ncomponent.  Hence,  the  alloys  studied  here  include  1  at.%  Ta.\nOne  of  the  primary  factor  that  limits  the  service  life  of  a  compo-\nnent  for  high  temperature  applications  is  oxidation,  which  can  lead\nto  the  loss  of  load-bearing  capacity  in  a  component  by  the  reduction\n∗Corresponding author.\nE-mail address:  david.dye@imperial.ac.uk  (D.

The\nexperimental results indicated that increasing the Co content from 7.9 to 15.8 wt pct decreased\nthe volume fraction of ( c+c¢) eutectic and the solidiﬁcation segregation ratio of W. High levels\nof Co additions were also found to decrease the solvus temperatures of the c¢phase and ( c+c¢)\neutectic as well as the solidus temperature. During the long-term thermal exposure at 1373 K\n(1100 /C176C), no TCP phases precipitated in either alloy. However, the coarsening and coalescence\nofc¢precipitates in the alloy containing 15.8 wt pct Co was slower than that in the other alloy\nwith 7.9 wt pct Co. In the current study, high levels of Co additions decreased the equilibrium\nvolume fraction of c¢phase, leading to a change in the partitioning ratios of TCP-forming\nelements Cr, Mo, Re, and W between the candc¢phases. This change resulted in a lower degree\nof elemental supersaturation in the cmatrix and improved the phase stability of the c/c¢\nmicrostructure. These experimental results were then compared with those obtained from multi-\ncomponent thermodynamic calculations, and good agreement was observed.\nDOI: 10.1007/s11661-013-2147-3\n/C211The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International 2013\nI. INTRODUCTION\nNi-BASED single-crystal superalloys with superior\nproperties at high temperature are widely used as turbine\nblades in aircraft engines. In the past 30 years, various\nalloying approaches were employed to develop multiple\nclasses or generations of Ni-based superalloys with\nimproved performance.[1]To enhance the degree of solid\nsolution strengthening in the cmatrix and control the\ncoarsening kinetics of the c¢precipitates, the level of Re\ncontent was continuously increased, from 0 wt pct in the\nﬁrst-generation single-crystal superalloys to 5 to 6 wt pct\nin the third and fourth generation superalloys.[2,3]Since\nRe additions exhibit limited solubility in the c¢phase, it\npartitions preferentially to the cphase. The overall\ncomposition of single-crystal Ni-based superalloys needs\nto be carefully controlled as supersaturation of the cphase\nwith Re, W, Mo, and Cr will lead to the microstructural\ninstabilities and the formation of detrimental topologi-cally close-packed (TCP) phases during exposures at\nelevated temperature. Ru additions have recently been\nidentiﬁed as an eﬀective suppressor of TCP phases and are\ncharacteristic additions in the fourth-generation single-\ncrystal superalloys.[4–7]Since alloys containing high levels\nof Re and Ru additions tend to have relatively high\ndensities and cost, the overall levels of these alloying\nadditions need to be reduced to meet the practical\ndemands of aircraft engines.\nCo is present in the large majority of commercially\navailable multi-component Ni-based superalloys. As an\nalloying addition, Co increases the strength at elevated\ntemperature by reducing the stacking fault energy of c\nmatrix.[8]It has been shown that Co inﬂuences the\nformation of c¢phase, carbides, and TCP phases in Ni-\nbased superalloys.[9–13]Previous studies had shown that\nincreasing the level of Co in wrought Ni-based super-\nalloys lowered the solvus temperatures of c¢phase and\ncarbides.[9]The volume fraction, mean size, and com-\nposition of c¢phase in the cast polycrystal"

Introduction 12\nNi base superalloys play an important role in the modern aircraft engine, 13\ncomprising approximately 40-50% of its weight [1]. The principal strengthen- 14\ning mechanisms are dependent on the presence of coherent L1 2-γ/primeprecipitates 15\n(Ni 3Al), in an FCC solid solution, A1- γmatrix. Ni base superalloys are chosen 16\nfor the hottest sections of gas turbines, due to the γ/primeprecipitates showing an 17\nanomalous increase strength with increasing temperature. Therefore, the alloys 18\nexhibit superior creep and fatigue properties at elevated temperatures [2, 3, 4]. 19\nThe increase in the number of aircraft worldwide and high oil prices make 20\nfuel economy the biggest challenge for the aircraft industry [5]. Increases in 21\ntemperature allow for improvements in cycle eﬃciency, and this design criterion 22\nis a potent driver for the development of new alloy systems to replace Ni base 23\nsuperalloys. These alloys are now quite mature, with successive generations 24\nshowing limited improvement in temperature capability. 25\nIn 2006, Sato et al. [6] discovered a new L1 2γ/primephase, Co 3(Al,W), in the 26\nCo-Al-W ternary system which coexists with the FCC Co matrix.

The development of these alloys is motivated\nby their higher melting temperatures: the simple Co–Al–W ternary\nalloy has solidus and liquidus temperatures /C24100/C176C higher than\ncommercial Ni-based superalloys [3]. With higher order alloying\nadditions that increase the c0solvus temperature, these c0strength-\nened Co-based superalloys may become a suitable alternative to\nNi-based superalloys in the near future [3–6] .\nDespite their promising high-temperature properties, the oxi-\ndation resistance of these alloys remains a concern. Initial studies\nat 900 /C176C showed inferior intrinsic oxidation resistance compared\nto Ni-based superalloys. Indeed, during oxidation, a brittle non-\nprotective Co-based oxide forms and spalls during isothermal\nand cyclic high temperature excursions [3,7] . Additions of boron\nand chromium have been found beneﬁcial up to 800 /C176C[6,8] . In iso-\nthermal tests at 900 /C176C and 1000 /C176C, Klein et al. have also found\nthat additions of boron and silicon promote the formation of pro-\ntective Al 2O3due to enhanced selective Al-oxidation [9]. Although\nSi-containing phases improve the oxidation resistance, they are\nalso expected to decrease the mechanical properties of the alloy\n[9].\nWhile materials utilised in high-temperature combustion envi-\nronments ideally have a high intrinsic resistance to oxidation andcorrosion, coatings may also be required in order for these alloys\nto be effectively deployed. For Co-based superalloys this is partic-ularly important, as small variations in Al and W content result in\ndramatic microstructural changes, which may be detrimental to\nhigh temperature properties [3]. Additionally, interdiffusion be-\ntween the coating and substrate may lead to degradation of the\ninterfaces and/or formation of detrimental phases at the alloy/\ncoating interface.\nInitial work by Pollock et al. attempted to improve oxidation\nresistance by aluminising and chromising the surface of the new\ncobalt-based alloys before carrying out oxidation tests [3]. Typi-\ncally, the high temperature oxidation resistance of alloys depends\non the stability of oxides of Cr and Al on the s"

Understanding the precipitation mechanisms upon different quenching \nmedia  can offer a bridge across cooling rate to mechanical  response. To date, extensive works \nhave been done to construct the relationship between cooling rate and mechanical \nperformance only using a limit ed quantity  of quenching media such as water, oil and air, \nresulting in the inadequ acy of process -microstruct ure-property database. In this work, a \nhigh-throughput approach  based on the Jominy end quench ing technique was developed to \nproduce a gradient dis tribution of γ’ precipitates within an individual specimen by introducing \na wide range of cooling rate s from 35 °C/min to 6346 °C/min. A transformation from \nunimodal to bimodal γ’ Particle Size Distribution (PSD) was observed along the end \nquenched specime n. The average  size of  γ’ precipitates  is inversely proportional with cooling \nrate in logarithmic scale . The hardness measurements display a strong dependence on cooling \nrate, which is explained by phase field simulation to provide deeper  insight into  the \ninteraction  between  dislocation  and γ’ precipitates . \n  \nKeywords:  High -throughput , solution  cooling rate, Ni -based superalloys, γ’ precipitates, \nhardness , phase field simulation  \n                                                 \n1 Now at Carpenter Technology, Reading, PA, 19601, USA  \nPage 3:\n \n \n \n1.

It was revealed that\npost-forging solid solution treatment at T>(Ts-50), where Tsis the\r0solvus temperature, led to a\nsigniﬁcant\rgrain growth, which in turn led to a decrease in strength and ductility of the superalloy.\nThe solution treatment at ( Ts-60)–( Ts-50) allowed to save ﬁne \rgrains ( d\r=10–20 \u0016m) and to provide\nthe formation of secondary \r0precipitates with a size of around 0.1 \u0016m. In the forged and heat-treated\nconditions, the superalloy demonstrated superior mechanical properties, particularly excellent creep\nresistance at 650–850\u000eC in the stress range of 400–1200 MPa. Microstructure examination of the\ncreep-tested samples showed that a decrease in the creep resistance at 850\u000eC can be associated with\nenhanced di \u000busivity along \rgrain and\r/\r0interphase boundaries leading to formation of cracks\nalong the boundaries. In spite of the heavy alloying, the topologically close-packed phases were not\ndetected in the superalloy, including in the creep tested samples.\nKeywords: nickel-based superalloy; microstructure; forging; solid solution treatment; ageing;\nmechanical properties; creep resistance\n1. Introduction\nImproving the energy e \u000eciency of gas turbine engines (GTE) and similar energy-conversion\nsystems is dependent on the development of new advanced materials with enhanced strength,\nheat resistance, and /or reduced speciﬁc weight. In particular, increasing demands are being placed\non nickel-based superalloys, which are widely used for manufacturing of rotary engine parts such as\nhigh pressure discs in GTE [ 1]. For this purpose, novel heavily alloyed disc superalloys with a higher\ncontent of the \r0(Ni 3Al) forming elements, such as Russian superalloy SDZhS-15, are being designed.\nIn this superalloy, the content of (Al +Ti+Nb+Ta) is 14.8 at. % and the ratio (Ti +Nb+Ta)/Al\n(in at. %) is 0.86, which indicates a signiﬁcant solid solution hardening of the \r0phase. The\rmatrix\nchemistry was optimized through a careful balance between the solid solution elements, such as Cr,\nCo, Mo, W, and Re [ 2,3]. Generally, the goals of alloying were to: (i) increase the \r0solvus temperature\nMetals 2020 ,10, 1606; doi:10.3390 /met10121606 www.mdpi.com /journal /metals\nPage 2:\nMetals"

Introduction\nDramatic improvements in the performance of gas\nturbines have resulted from the development of direc-tional solidiﬁcation and the production of single crystalturbine blades and vanes [1–3]. During solidiﬁcation,some elements partition to the dendrite core, whileother elements tend to accumulate in the interdendriticliquid and then solidify as the interdendritic and eutec-tic regions. For example, W and Re are reported topartition to the dendrite core, whereas, Ta, Al and Tipartition to the interdendritic region [4]. The resultingsegregation must be eliminated and all of the /p107/p37and\n/p107//p107/p37eutectic must be put into solution by subsequent\nheat treatments.As new alloys have been developed, the refractory\nmetal alloy additions have continued to rise. In particu-lar, the W, Re and Ta levels have increased steadily inthe ﬁrst three generations of single crystal Ni-basesuperalloys [5]. For example, the refractory metal (i.e.W+Mo+Re+Ta) contents of representative ﬁrst\n(CMSX-2), second (CMSX-4) and third generation(CMSX-10) alloys has increased (Table 1) from about14 to/p5816.5 wt% and then to /p9220 wt%, respectively\n[5]. These increased refractory elements result in alloyswith increased strength and creep resistance due toincreased solid solution strengthening, strengthening ofthe/p107/p37and slowed diffusion rates.\nThe increased refractory metal contents which result\nin slowed diffusion and creep rates, also result inslowed diffusion during solution heat treatments andincreased levels of elemental segregation. Therefore, thesecond and third generation alloys require increasedsolution heat treatment temperatures and times to fullysolution all of the /p107/p37and eliminate segregation. Typical\ncommercial heat treatment cycles for the three genera-tions of single crystals are presented in Table 2. Note\n* Corresponding author.

The γ′solvus temperature and the γ′volume fraction were experimentally determined as 1247 °C\nand 85.2%. Thermodynamic calculations correctly predict the tendency of how the alloying elements in ﬂuence\nthe thermophysical properties of investigated alloys. In comparison with the original Co-Ni-Al-W-Ti-Ta alloy, thenewly developed CoNi-base alloy exhibited stronger compressive strength ranging from the room temperature to\n1100 °C. The deformation behaviors at di ﬀerent temperature stages were investigated in detail. Interestingly,\nsuperlattice intrinsic stacking faults (SISFs) appear in the specimen deformed at the anomalous peak tempera-\nture, whereas the formation of SISF in the original Co-Ni-Al-W-Ti-Ta alloy occurs as the compression tem-\nperature increases beyond the anomalous peak temperature. The relationship between the occurrence of planar\ndefects and the alloying eﬀ ects was discussed.\n1. Introduction\nConventional Co-base superalloys strengthened by metal carbides\nexhibit insu ﬃcient high-temperature strength for structural applica-\ntions as the temperature increases beyond 800 °C [1]. In contrast, Ni-\nbase superalloys exhibit outstanding high-temperature mechanical\nproperties resulted from the thermodynamically stable microstructure\ncomposed of L1 2precipitates ( γ′) and face-centered cubic A1 matrix ( γ).\nHence Ni-base superalloys always play a critical role withstanding thehottest section of turbine engines. To enhance the performance of tur-\nbine engines, increasing the thermal e ﬃciency should be the priority\ntask but which is currently limited by the unchangeable solidus tem-perature of Ni-base superalloys. Due to the higher melting point of\ncobalt, Co-base alloys have been considered as a promising alloy system\nwhich could outperform Ni-base superalloys in high-temperature ap-\nplication areas. From decades ago researchers began seeking for Co-\nbase systems that strengthened by L1\n2precipitates ( γ′) and enable to\nexhibit the positive temperature dependence of the yield stress, such asCo-Ti [2–5]and Co-Ta [6,7] . However, numerous disadvantages hinder\nthe development of these alloys including insu ﬃcient thermal stability\nof the microstructure, low γ′solvus temperatures, and undesirable high\nmagnitudes of the lattice mis ﬁt between γand γ′phases. Until recently,\nSato et al. [8]discovered a new class of Co-base superalloy, Co-Al-Wsuperalloy, with ternary L1\n2γ′-Co3(Al,W) precipitates embedded in the\nγ-Co matrix. Co-Al-W superalloys exhibit acceptable lattice mis ﬁts be-\ntween γand γ′phases, ﬁne thermal stabilities of the microstructure, and\nstrong yield stress anomaly (YSA"

Introduction\nNickel-base single crystal superalloys are state of the art\nturbine blade materials that consist of high volume fractionsof cuboidal ordered L1\n2/H9253/primeprecipitates in coherent with\nthe disordered FCC /H9253matrix [1]. The turbine blades dictate\nperformances of turbine section of the jet engine and haveprofound impact on the thermal efﬁciency [2]. Hence, recent\ntrends to further enhance the engine efﬁciency by increasing theturbine inlet temperatures have placed greater demand for newsuperalloys with improved elevated temperature properties,especially creep resistance [2,3] . Current commercial Ni-base\nsingle crystal superalloys are heavily alloyed with solid solutionstrengthening elements, such as W, Mo and Re; the ability toincorporate further refractory content has been limited due tothe precipitations of topologically close packed (TCP) phasesduring exposure at elevated temperatures [4]. Formation of TCP\nphases can deplete strengthening elements such as W, Mo andRe from the /H9253//H9253\n/primematrix and is often associated with the initiation\n∗Corresponding author.

Ru addition in Ni-base superalloys can\nsuppress the formation of TCP precipitates and has then becomecritical to the development of new generations of superalloy[6–8] . The enhanced microstructural stability due to Ru can\naccommodate additional refractory contents that not onlyfurther solid solution strengthen the alloy, but also increase the/H9253//H9253\n/primelattice misﬁt, which is one of the parameters for controlling\nthe formation of /H9253/primeraft and /H9253//H9253/primeinterfacial dislocation network\n[9].

Introduction\nNi-based superalloys are widely used in power industries,\nsuch as for making gas turbine components, due to their\nexcellent high-temperature properties (Ref 1). Extensive studies\nhave shown that various microstructural changes in the gas\nturbine blades during long-term thermal exposure (LTTE) or\nservice have signiﬁcant effects on the mechanical properties\n(Ref 2–8). Therefore, microstructural stability of gas turbine\nblade materials is signiﬁcantly important to the reliability of the\ngas turbine. The mechanical properties of nickel-based super-\nalloys are strongly dependent upon microstructural factors such\nas morphology, particle size, surface fraction, coarsening rate\nand composition of L1 2-type ordered c¢[Ni3(Al, Ti)] phase\nprecipitated coherently with the cmatrix (Ref 9–12) and\ncarbides. The blades in current advanced gas turbines are\nexposed to extremely high temperature and stress which give\nrise to signiﬁcant microstructural degradation, such as MCcarbide decomposition, agglomeration of c¢phase and forma-\ntion of minor phases. MC carbides usually form in superalloys\nduring freezing, and they are a major source of carbon for the\nalloy (Ref 13). MC carbides generally decompose into M 23C6\nandgphase during thermal exposure, especially for the alloys\nwith high contents of Ti, Ta or Hf (Ref 14). It is well known\nthat microstructure of nickel-based superalloys highly depends\non applied heat treatments. Therefore, it becomes crucial to\noptimize the microstructure of superalloys through appropriate\nheat treatments. High-temperature homogenization treatments\nare usually conducted for dissolving the c–c¢eutectics,\ndissolving the c¢phase for subsequent re-precipitation and\nreducing the chemical segregation of the elements (Ref 15–17).\nNevertheless, recrystallization, as one of the major difﬁculties\nin producing and rejuvenation process of directionally solidi-\nﬁed and single-crystal blades with large size and complex\nstructure, may be induced during high-temperature homoge-\nnization treatments.

Introduction\nThe development of superalloys has been driven by the\ndemand to increase the operating temperatures of gas tur-\nbines in power plants and aircraft engines. Among various\nclasses of superalloys, including Fe-base, Co-base and Ni-base superalloys, Ni-base superalloys strengthened withthe L1\n2compound ( c0phase) possess the highest heat resis-\ntance. For the highest-temperature applications, they aresolidiﬁed into a single-crystal form, and alloyed to achievea high volume fraction of the c\n0precipitates, good solid-\nsolution strengthening of the candc0phases along with\nenvironmental resistance. The superior strength of c/c0\nNi-base superalloys at elevated temperature can be attrib-\nuted to a high volume fraction of regularly aligned coher-entc\n0precipitates with a cuboidal shape that inhibit the\ndislocation glide in the cchannels [1,2]. In the mostadvanced Ni-base single-crystal superalloys, the volume\nfraction of the c0phase reaches approximately 70%.\nRecently, a stable ternary Co 3(Al,W) phase with L1 2\nstructure was discovered by Sato et al. [3]. The c0-Co 3\n(Al,W) phase thermodynamically equilibrates with c-Co\n(fcc) solid-solution phase in the Co–Al–W ternary alloysystem at 1173 K. In addition, the small misﬁt betweenthecandc\n0phases permits the formation of a coherent\ntwo-phase microstructure where submicron cuboidal c0\nprecipitates align regularly in a continuous matrix phase.\nThis is morphologically identical to the microstructure ofc/c\n0two-phase Ni-base superalloys. Conventional Co-base\nsuperalloys lack eﬀective precipitation strengthening by\nintermetallic compounds, and depend on solid-solution ele-ments and precipitation of low volume fraction of carbidesfor their strength. Despite their inferior strength comparedto the Ni-base superalloys, Co-base superalloys generallyoﬀer better oxidation, corrosion and wear resistance, andhave therefore been utilized in components where environ-mental resistance is required, such as gas turbine vanes,\n1359-6454/$34.00 /C2112007 Acta Materialia Inc.

Microstructures were investigated using a scanning electron micro-scope (SEM). Tensile testing was performed at room temperature and 700 /C176C and the deformed samples\nwere examined using SEM and transmission electron microscope (TEM). It was found that in the as-HIPed\ncondition the microstructure consisted of coarse and irregular-shaped primary and secondary\nc0together\nwith a low volume fraction of ﬁne c0(<50 nm in diameter). Solution treatment below the c0solvus fol-\nlowed by air cooling resulted in the formation of ﬁner cuboidal secondary c0(350–750 nm) and med-\nium-sized spherical tertiary c0(100–200 nm). This led to an improvement of both the 0.2% yield\nstrength and ultimate tensile strength. Ageing of the solution-treated or of the as-HIPed samples at760/C176C resulted in the precipitation of a high population of ﬁne\nc0(around 50 nm) which further increased\nthe strength. Within the resolution limit of the current TEM analysis, deformation at room temperature\nseemed to occur mainly by dislocations cutting through secondary c0and very ﬁne c0, accompanied by\nthe formation of stacking faults within these precipitates; most of the medium-sized tertiary c0precipi-\ntates in solution-treated and aged samples were not cut through but were surrounded by dislocations.\nDeformation at 700 /C176C happened by dislocations cutting through c0precipitates and cmatrix, leading\nto the formation of extended stacking faults across both candc0. It is suggested that the optimum treat-\nment of the current powder superalloy is to solution-treat and age after HIPing; this results in properties\nwhich are comparable with those of thermomechanically processed samples.\nCrown Copyright /C2112013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\nThe need for jet engines to operate at higher temperatures to in-\ncrease efﬁciency requires the development of nickel-based super-\nalloys containing increased amount of the main strengthening\nelements such as Ti, Al, Mo, W, Ta and Hf. However, increased\nalloying usually leads to extensive segregation in the cast ingots\nwhich results in signiﬁcant reduction in their hot workability.\nThe decrease in workability adversely affects the overall compo-\nnent cost and the ability to achieve the desired properties. This\nhas spurred the development of powder metallurgy (PM) tech-\nniques for producing components of highly alloyed compositions\nto achieve the desired microstructures, properties, and cost effec-\ntiveness. At present the nickel-based superalloy powders are HIPed\nto produce a billet after which it is processed following almost the\nsame route as an ingot – involving extensive extrusion, forging and\nmachining so that any prior particle boundaries (PPBs) or large\ninclusions are broken down.

The γ/γ′lattice parameter mis ﬁt of the alloys\ndecreases from 0.72% to 0.50%, and the γ′coarsening rate constant K of alloys decreases from\n0.30 × 10−27m3s−1to 0.073 × 10−27m3s−1as Re content increasing form 1 at. % to 5 at. %. Additionally, the\nvolume fraction of γ′phase (V γ′) increases from 42.15% to 53.19% and the γ′solvus temperature increases from\n1059 °C to 1085 °C ( Tsolvus- γ′) with increasing Re content. Moreover, the 0.2% ﬂow stresses and the 0.2% speci ﬁc\nﬂow stresses of all three alloys exhibit negative temperature dependence at the temperatures ranging from room\ntemperature to 900 °C. And both the 0.2% ﬂow stresses and the 0.2% speci ﬁcﬂow stresses increase with the Re\ncontent.\n1. Introduction\nCo-based alloys possess some advantageous properties, such as ex-\ncellent corrosion resistance and high melting point [ 1–3]. Thus, Co-\nbased alloys are widely used in industrial ﬁelds including gas turbine\nindustries, petrochemical industries, and nuclear power plants etc.\nSince Sato et al. reported the outstanding performance of the γ/γ′\ntwo-phase Co –Al–W alloy in 2006 [ 4],γ′-strengthen Co-based super-\nalloys have attracted researchers ’attention. But the γ′phase in\nCo–Al–W ternary was metastable [ 5]. It needs to incorporate many\nother elements like Ni, Ti, Ta, B, etc. to improve its thermal stability\n[6–8]. Moreover, as the strength to weight ratio is crucial, the high\ndensity (9.45 g cm−3[4]) makes the Co –Al–W alloy unattractive for\napplications. Then, some researchers paid attention to other Co-basesystems [ 9–11]. The γ′-Co\n3Ti is a stable phase and has advantages of\nlow density and high ductility [ 12–18]. However, the application of the\nCo3Ti phase is limited due to its disadvantages of low volume fractions,\nhigh γ/γ′lattice parameter mismatch [ 19–21]. Recently, some re-\nsearchers tried to alloy other elements such as V and Cr in the Co-Ti-\nbased system to improve the microstructure stability and mechanicalproperty [ 22–25]. The results showed that the Co –Ti–Cr alloy [ 22] and\nCo–Ti–V alloy [ 25] have good performance at high temperature range\n(800 –1000 °C). Even though, their strengths were still much less than\nthat of the Ni-based superalloys at whole temperature ranging fromroom temperature to high temperature. It would greatly limit the wide\nuse of the Co-Ti-based alloys. Thus, the further studies in the Co-Ti-X\nsuperalloys are required.\nRe i"

Introduction\nNickel-base alloys with densities exceeding 8 g/cm2may not\ninitially be thought of as viable materials for acreage thermalprotection systems (TPS). Indeed, the Space Shuttle utilizesmany types of non-metallic TPS materials, in both tile and fab-\nric form as well as reinforced carbon–carbon on the nose andwing leading edges.\n1However, shuttle refurbishment between\nﬂights has been reported to require >17,000 h of labor,2or a\nlevel of maintenance which is unacceptable for Air Force appli-cations. Hence, thin gage metallic sheet and foil may become an\noption for TPS because the turn-around time for inspection canbe signiﬁcantly reduced, durability is improved, and replace-ment time is short because metallic TPS (MTPS) panels aremechanically attached. Indeed honeycomb MTPS was evaluated(Fig. 1 ) and would have comprised a signiﬁcant portion of the\nacreage TPS on the lower surface of the NASA X-33 vehicle,\n2a\nwedged-shaped subscale prototype of a reusable launch vehicle3\ndesigned by Lockheed Martin. Nevertheless, while MTPS canplay a role in these systems, there will always be a need for non-metallic materials in areas for which an extreme environment (in\n∗Corresponding author.

Such materials must be capable of being pro-cessed to thin gages on the order of 0.25 mm, which is atypical face sheet thickness for metallic honeycomb panels.Platinum-modiﬁed nickel aluminide ( /H9252-NiAl) compositions,\ne.g. Ni–50Al–15Pt, are currently used throughout the turbine-engine industry for airfoil coatings because of their oxidationresistance.\n4–7Unfortunately, these compositions are brittle and\nare not practical for a monolithic application across the servicetemperature range, particularly below 600\n◦C.8,9On the other\nhand, research on "

HENRY\nWhen an extruded strain-free RENE Â88 Ni-base superalloy about 1 to 2 mm in grain diameter is heat-\ntreated at 1150 8C, abnormal grain growth (AGG) begins after 50 hours. When heat-treated at 1200\n8C,AGGoccursat15minutes.Someofthegrainboundariesarefacetedwithhill-and-valleystructures\nwhen observed in transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the occurrence of AGG is consistent\nwith the boundary step and dislocation mechanism for the migration of singular boundaries with\nfaceted shapes,as observed andproposed in otherpure metals andalloys. Thedissolution of abundant\ng8precipitates (with a solvus temperature of 1107 8C), which are coherent with the matrix and hence\nstrongly pin the grain boundaries, does not cause AGG during early stages of heat-treatment at 1150\n8C. Small deformations drastically alter the AGG behavior. When deformed to 4 pct, AGG begins\nafter heat-treating for 10 minutes at 1150 8C, compared to the apparent incubation time of 50 hours\nforanundeformedspecimen,andverylargeabnormalgrainsareproduced.Withincreasingdeformationto 6 and 9.2 pct, the abnormal grain size decreases. These results are qualitatively similar to thoseobserved in Cu. This deformation effect on AGG is attributed to the absorption of lattice dislocations\nin the grain boundaries, which produces nonequilibrium structures that, in turn, can apparently cause\nrapid boundary migration. When heat-treated at 1200 8C, the largest abnormal grains are found in\nthe specimens deformed to 2 pct. When the initial grain size is increased to about 14\nmm by heat-\ntreating the extruded alloy at 1150 8C for 30 minutes, similar low deformation effects on AGG are\nobserved. When these specimens are deformed to 10, 13, and 15.2 pct, primary recrystallizationoccurs during the heat-treatment at 1150 8C, and large abnormal grains are again produced because\nof the small recrystallized grain size. Therefore, there are two peaks in the grain size vsdeformation\ncurve after heat-treating at 1150 8C for 1 hour. A pre-heat-treatment of this alloy at 1050 8C below\nthe solvus temperature of the\ng8phase greatly reduces the size of the abnormal grains obtained in\nthe specimen deformed to 4 pct after the heat-treatment at 1150 8C, probably because some recovery\nof the dislocations takes place at grain boundaries during the pre-heat-treatment. The deformationeffect on AGG observed in this alloy is qualitatively similar to that previously observed in Cu and\nappears to be consistent with the boundary step and dislocation mechanism for AGG.\nI.

INTRODUCTION\nDUEto their inherent ability to withstand deforma-\ntion at temperatures approaching their melting temper-atures, nickel-based superalloys are among the most\nimportant structural materials for use in extreme high\ntemperature applications. Application areas includeland-based power generation, rocket propulsion, and\naero-propulsion. In particular, Ni superalloys are tradi-\ntionally used for making turbine components in thehottest sections of turbine engines as these alloys have\nthe best combination of required properties, such as\ncreep resistance, temperature capability, environmentalresistance, and damage tolerance, compared to other\ncommercial alloys.\n[1,2]The fuel economy, reduction of\ncarbon emission, and the eﬃciency of generating powerof a turbine engine are known to improve considerablywith an increase in the turbine inlet temperature and the\nturbine rotating speed.\n[2,3]Therefore, numerous eﬀorts\nhave been made to improve the temperature capabilityof Ni superalloys through the development of new alloy\ngrades, modiﬁcations of the processing parameters, and\ndesign modiﬁcations of the turbo-machinery compo-nents.\n[3–9]Two main grades of superalloys are currently\navailable. These are (i) ﬁne-grained powder metallurgy\n(PM) alloys, such as Rene 88, IN100, or LSHR, whichpossess very high strength at temperatures up to 973 Kto 1033 K (700 /C176C to 760 /C176C), but have insuﬃcient creep\nresistance at higher temperatures, and (ii) single-crystal\nor coarse-grained cast alloys, such as Rene N6, CMSX-10, or Mar-M247, which have outstanding creep resis-\ntance at temperatures up to ~1273 K (1000 /C176C), but\nhave almost twice lower strength than the PM superal-\nloys at lower temperatures. At the same time, manyadvanced applications require diﬀerent sections of a\nsingle structural component to operate in very diﬀerent\ntemperature and loading conditions. An attractive wayto fulﬁll this requirement is thought to design andfabricate a hybrid structure consisting of several super-\nalloys joined together. In such design, sections operating\nunder high loading conditions, but at lower tempera-tures, are made of a PM alloy, while sections requiring\noutstanding creep resistance at higher temperatures are\nmade of a cast alloy.\nOne method that can be utilized to produce complex\ngeometries and hybrid structures from Ni superalloys is\nwelding. Unfortunately, traditional fusion welding tech-niques generally cannot be used for Ni superalloys,\nwhich have high volume fractions of c¢particles, as these\nresult in welding defects such as liquation cracking,strain age cracking, etc.\n[10,11]Inertia"

INTRODUCTION\nTHEdevelopment of Ni-based superalloys has been\ninextricably linked to the needs of the aerospace\nindustry and its regulators. Jet engines are continuously\nevolving to provide improved eﬃciencies combined withreduced environmental and acoustic emissions.[1,2]How-\never, while aerodynamic design optimizations of aircraft\nengines are possible, the service conditions that can be\ntolerated by the superalloys used in the critical turbine\nparts limit the eﬃciency improvements that can be\nachieved.\nThe requirement for increased temperatures and\nstresses in service and reduced engine core sizes consti-\ntutes a complex set of conﬂicting properties for the\nmaterials considered for disk rotor applications. For\nexample, the desire to reduce the size and weight of\ncomponents requires materials with higher strength\nlevels, which can be achieved through a ﬁne grain size\nand increases in the volume fraction of the strengthening\nc¢phase. Yet such microstructures cause deterioration in\nthe time dependent crack growth performance of the\nmaterial that may limit the design life of the component.\nWhile the overall alloy chemistry is critically important\nin obtaining these properties, microstructure is equally\nsigniﬁcant in ensuring that the alloy delivers the desired\nhigh temperature performance. Alloy design and pro-\ncessing is further complicated by likely changes in\nmicrostructure and phase stability as a result of long\nduration exposures at temperatures above 700 /C176C.\nKATERINA A.

When heat-treated at 1200 8C abnormal grain growth occurs and most\nof the grain boundaries are observed to be faceted by optical microscopy, transmission electron mi-croscopy, and scanning electron microscopy at the intergranular fracture surface. Some of the grain bound-ary facet planes are expected to be singular corresponding to the cusps in the polar plot of the boundaryenergy against the inclination angle, and it is proposed that if these boundary segments move by a bound-\nary step mechanism, the abnormal grain growth can occur. When heat-treated at 1300 8C normal grain\ngrowth occurs, the grain boundaries are defaceted, and hence atomically rough. Normal growth is expectedif the migration rate of the rough grain boundaries increases linearly with the driving force arising fromthe grain size di/C128erence. The correlation between the grain boundary structural transition and the growthbehavior thus appears to be general in pure metals and solid solution alloys. 72000 Acta Metallurgica\nInc.

INTRODUCTION\nAt temperatures close to 0 K all crystals in equili-\nbrium with a surrounding vapor or liquid are pre-dicted [1–7] and have indeed been observed [8–11]to be polyhedral with atomically ﬂat singular sur-face planes. At high temperatures each singular sur-face plane can undergo roughening transition aspredicted initially by Burton et al . [12]. At the\nroughening temperature T\nRthe planar surface is\npredicted to become curved [13] and at high tem-peratures some grains even become spherical [14–19]. The curved surface shape thus manifests therough atomic structures which have been conﬁrmed\nby di/C128raction methods [20, 21]. The growth beha-\nvior of a single crystal from melt or solution wasfound to depend critically on the surface structure[22–24]. It was also proposed that both the coarsen-ing of many grains dispersed in a liquid matrix [25,26] and the growth of catalytic metal particles on asubstrate [27, 28] also depended critically on theirshape and hence on their surface structure.\nIn the early 1970s Hart [29, 30] proposed aﬁrst order structural transition of a grain bound-\nary treating it as a two-dimensional phase. Atabout the same time Gleiter [31] also proposed agrain boundary phase transition based on the ob-servation of apparently discontinuous change ofthe energies of two grain boundaries in Pb atabout 0.73 T\nmand 0.76 Tm, where Tmis the melting\npoint. (These were probably defaceting transitionsas pointed out by Cahn [32].) Simpson et al. [33]\nalso suggested that the observed slope changes ofthe log of the grain boundary migration ratesagainst the reciprocal temperature were due tograin boundary transitions. Later (in 1986)Rottman [34] predicted the roughening transition oflow angle grain boundaries by making an analogywith a stepped surface. Shvindlerman and Straumal[35"

The results show that sub-solvus solution heat treatment changes the microstructure of an as-forged\nalloy. It makes large primary c0phases at grain boundaries smaller and the distribution of secondary c0\nphases in the interior of the grains more homogeneous. Moreover, the grain boundaries widen because ofthe supplementary precipitate. The sub-solvus solution heat treatment before the super-solvus solution\nheat treatment does not change nucleation sites of the\nc0fan-type structures which precipitate during the\nsuper-solvus solution heat treatment. However, it inﬂuences the morphology of c0fan-type structures.\nLength distribution of the secondary c0dendrites in fan-type structures changes from a bimodal to a uni-\nmodal distribution, which means the lengths of the secondary c0dendrites become more uniform. Apply-\ning a sub-solvus solution heat treatment after the super-solvus solution heat treatment causes thesecondary\nc0dendrites to be broken off in the fan-type structures and a reﬁnement of the c0phases,\nand this improves stability of the c0phases.\n/C2112013 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\nCompared with cast and wrought superalloys, nickel-based\npowder metallurgy (P/M) superalloys are produced with more uni-\nform composition and microstructure, more consistent grain and\nprecipitate size [1–3] . Therefore, nickel-based P/M superalloys\nhave been widely used as turbine disk materials in advanced en-\ngines with a high thrust-weight ratio [4,5] . A ﬁne microstructure\nis required for the bore region of turbine disks, to ensure sufﬁcient\ntensile strength and fatigue resistance, as the bore usually operates\nat low temperatures (420–650 /C176C) and endures the torsion and\ncentrifugal forces of the turboshaft [6,7] . At the same time, a coarse\nmicrostructure is needed for the rim region to ensure enough resis-\ntance to stress rupture, creep and fatigue crack growth, as the rim\nis close to the gas channel and it undergoes high service tempera-\ntures (>760 /C176C)[8,9] . Therefore, a dual grain microstructure turbine\ndisk is required which has a ﬁne grain bore and coarse grain rim.Such turbine disks with dual properties belong to a new turbine-\ndisk generation, which has dual grain microstructures and can\nmeet the need of aircraft engines with a high thrust-weight.A new kind of heat treatment process (Dual Microstructure\nHeat Treatment, DMHT) has been developed by the NASA GlennResearch Center to obtain P/M turbine disks with dual properties\n[10].

Introduction\nIt has been well known that c¢-strengthened nickel-based\nsuperalloys are specially developed for structural applications\nat elevated temperature owing to their favorable combination of\ngood high-temperature strength, excellent creep resistance and\noutstanding corrosion resistance. Waspaloy, Rene ¢41 and\nInconel 740H are known to be representative nickel-based\nsuperalloys and have been widely used in gas turbines,\ncombustion systems and other critical applications related to\nnuclear technology and power generation from coal (Ref 1-3).\nGH4282 (Haynes 282), a newly developed c¢-strengthened\nnickel-based superalloy, is designed to meet the demands for\nperformance at a high service temperature while maintaining\nweldability and fabricability (Ref 4,5). For this alloy, moderate\namounts of Al and Ti not only can form c¢precipitation to\nstrengthen the matrix but can also prevent the deterioration of\nthe welding performance. Co and Mo are used as solution\nstrengthening elements. Meanwhile, the addition of Co would\nbe effective for the precipitation of the c¢phase and increase the\nsuperalloys stability at higher temperatures. Cr plays an\nimportant role in providing a resistance to hot corrosion and\noxidation. C, together with Cr, Mo and Ti, is used to form\nM23C6,M 6C and MC carbides, which appear at grain\nboundaries in the desired morphology to produce good creep\nstrength and ductility. Furthermore, B, Ce and Mg are usuallyadded in trace amounts to strengthen the grain boundary.\nTherefore, GH4282 exhibits good comprehensive mechanical\nproperties. In particular, the new alloy has a unique combina-\ntion of excellent creep strength and thermal stability that\napproach or transcend those of commonly used superalloys,\nsuch as Waspaloy and Rene ¢41 (Ref 5).\nAs a relatively new alloy, the previous research on GH4282\nsuperalloy mainly focused on its microstructure characteriza-\ntion during a heat treatment or welding process, the fatigue\nproperties and the oxidation behavior (Ref 6-9). It is well\nknown that for superalloys, the desirable microstructure and\nrequired mechanical performance are largely dependent on the\nhot working process. However, the hot deformation process of\nGH4282 superalloy is very complicated due to the increase in\nthe number of alloying elements and the complex system of\nphases.

Introduction  \nNi-based superalloys have been successfully used fo r critical structural components in \ngas turbine engines for several decades due to thei r excellent mechanical properties and \ngood oxidation resistance at high temperatures up t o 650 \u0002 [1,2,3]. With the fuel efficiency \nimprovement of gas turbine engines, it is imperativ e to develop new Ni-based superalloys \nto withstand severe environmental attacks which red uce the service life at higher \ntemperature. Because of the high production cost of  powder metallurgy superalloys, an \nurgent requirement to develop a commercial cast-wro ught superalloy for turbine disc \napplications at higher temperature occurs [4,5]. GH 4730 Ni-based superalloy was \ndeveloped because of its superior combination of go od service properties at higher \ntemperatures from 700 to 750 \u0002 and comparatively low production cost compared to other \ncast-wrought superalloys. \nHot deformation behavior of Ni-based superalloys pl ays a critical role in the turbine \ndisk manufacture and is influenced "

Thus, the high-temperature ﬂow behavior of a c-c¢\nCo-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Ta-2Ti-5Cr (at. pct) superalloy was investigated using isothermal com-\npression tests between 1348 and 1498 K at strain rates from 0.001 to 10 s/C01. The mcontour map\nwas generated using the experimental ﬂow stress values, which were used to locate the optimum\nhot workability and desired microstructural processing range. A strong dependence of mon the\ndeformation parameters (temperature, strain rate, and strain) was observed. A maximum m\nvalue of around 0.3 at 1460 K to 1498 K and strain rates of 0.01 to 0.5 s/C01was found. The\ndeformed samples show a fully recrystallized microstructure at high m.

INTRODUCTION\nSUPERALLOYS are high-temperature structural\nmaterials mainly used in land-based and aircraft turbine\nengine components such as discs, blades, rotating shafts,\nnozzle guide vanes, and combustor liners.[1,2]For the\nfabrication of these critical components with the desired\nmicrostructural and mechanical properties, the alloys\nmust undergo several crucial hot deformation pro-\ncesses.[3,4]At high temperatures, the ﬂow behavior of\nthese metallic alloys is complex and sensitive to ther-\nmomechanical parameters such as the temperature,\nstrain rate, and strain.[5]Thus, during high-temperature\ndeformation, it is essential to control the thermome-\nchanical parameters to achieve the required properties.\nWork hardening and softening (dynamic recovery and\nrecrystallization) mechanisms are the two dominantmetallurgical phenomena that occur during the\nhigh-temperature deformation process.[6]Thus, it is\nimportant to characterize and understand the dynamic\nrecrystallization behavior of these alloys, which reﬁnes\nthe coarse grains and aﬀects the ﬂow stress during hot\ndeformation.\nSuperalloys based on cobalt have applications as\ncritical turbine engine parts, where hot corrosion, wear,\nand oxidation resistance are required.[7–9]Some of the\nmost widely used commercial cobalt alloys such as\nHaynes 188, stellite, and MAR-M are strengthened by\nthe use of solidsolutions and metallic carbides.[10,11]\nThese alloys possess good resistance to oxidation and\nhot corrosion. The strength values at high temperatures\nare inadequate compared to nickel-based superalloys,\nwhich derive their strength from their c-c¢microstruc-\nture. Recently, it was shown that the formation of a c-c¢\nmicrostructure in cobalt-based alloy systems (Co-Al-W\nand Co-Al-Mo-Nb/Ta-based alloys) could overcome\nthis drawback, enabling the development of high--\nstrength, high-temperature cobalt-based superal-\nloys.[12,13]Signiﬁcant"

Introduction \nNi-base superalloys with high volume fraction of the hardenin g\nc0-phase are widely employed as blade material in aero-engi nes \nand land-base gas turbines, due to their outstanding high-tempe r- \nature creep and fatigue strength as well as excellent oxidation and \ncorrosion resistance [1–3] . Nevertheless, service-indu ced micro- \nstructural degenerations in nickel-bas ed superalloy components \nsubjected to high temperatures and stresses in aggressive environ- \nments are inevitable, including c0coarsenin g, carbide decomposi- \ntion, formatio n of topologically close packed (TCP) phase and \ncreep cavitation [2,4,5] . The mechanical properties are thus signif- \nicantly degraded due to the microstructural instability, ultimately \nresulting in the loss of life. \nFortunately , it has been demonstrated that the degraded micro- \nstructure of many superalloys can be recovered to its desired mor- \nphology through an appropriate rejuvenati on heat treatment (RHT)\nwhich consists of solutioning and aging heat treatments [6,7] .\nFurthermore, hot isostatic pressing (HIP) has been successfu lly em- \nployed to heal creep induced cavities in a wide variety of superal- \nloys [8,9] . So far, HIP rejuvenation technology (involving HIP and \nRHT) has been widely utilized to extend the service life of hot-sec- \ntion components. The develope d rejuvenation schedules, however ,\nvary depending on the alloy type and the accumulate d damage. \nHence, a series of experiments have to be conducte d in order to \ndetermine an optimal schedule. Extensive research efforts have \nbeen made in verifying the effectivenes s of HIP and rejuvenation heat treatments [6–10] . Meanwhile, the effects of HIP temperature \nor pressure on the microstructural evolution have been investi- \ngated in order to determine appropriate processing paramete rs of \nrejuvenati on [11–13] . In our previous work [14] , the effectiveness \nof HIP rejuvenation in the restoration of microstructure and rup- \nture life for K465 alloy has been demonstrated. Creep induced cav- \nities can be sintered under appropriate HIP conditions. However, \nthe interaction of HIP pressure and temperature on cavity healing \nhas not been reported yet to our knowledge, which is meaningful \nto better understand the healing mechanism of cavities under \nHIP.

Considering\nthe chemical similarity between tantalum and niobium (Nb) and the lower cost of Nb, a modiﬁed MAR-\nM247 superalloy was produced with total replacement of Ta by Nb in this work. The samples were\npreviously solutioned at 1260 /C176C for 8 h and then aged at different times (between 5 and 80 h) and tem-\nperatures (between 780 and 980 /C176C). The microstructures of the aged samples were characterized with a\nscanning electron microscope (SEM and FEG-SEM, both with EDS). Simulations of the MC carbide and c¢\nfraction and the Ta and Nb content in both MC carbide and c¢phase were performed with Thermo-Calc\nsoftware (TT_Ni8 database) and simulations of the c¢growth rate and c¢mean diameter were performed\nwith JMatPro software. MC carbide with high Hf content was observed in all the aged samples, inagreement with thermodynamic simulation results. The equilibrium c¢fraction decreases from 67 mol.% at\n780/C176C to 52 mol.% at 980 /C176C. Good agreement between the calculated and experimentally determined c¢\nparticle size was also found. The growth rate of c¢at 980 /C176C is about 8 times higher than that at 780 /C176C and 3\ntimes higher than that at 880 /C176C. The hardness values do not change considerably after aging at 780 and\n880/C176C. However, these values decrease signiﬁcantly after aging at 980 /C176C.\nKeywords aging, JMatPro, MAR-M247, nickel-based superalloy,\nniobium, Thermo-Calc\n1. Introduction\nMAR-M247 is a polycrystalline nickel-based superalloy that\nhas excellent mechanical and oxidation resistance at elevatedtemperatures (Ref 1,2). It is possible to achieve more than 60\nvol.% of c¢phase in the microstructure of this superalloy\nthrough correct solution and aging heat treatments (Ref 1-3). Its\ncomposition contains 3 wt.% tantalum; considering the chem-ical similarity between tantalum and niobium and the lower\ncost of niobium, a modiﬁed MAR-M247 superalloy, here called\nMAR-M247(Nb), was produced with total replacement oftantalum by niobium atoms.\nNiobium is a refractory element normally present in the\ncomposition of nickel-based superalloys, replacing aluminumatoms in c¢phase and contributing to the formation of carbides thatincrease grain boundary cohesion (Ref 4,5). Niobium also\ncontributes to the strength of the superalloy by increasing thevolume fraction and thermal stability of the c¢phase (Ref 5-7). For\nexample, more than 50% of cast nickel-based superalloys have\nbetween 1 and 2.5 wt.% of niobium in their composition (Ref 7).\nAging heat treatment of Ni-based superalloys generally\nemulates solution heat treatment and provides increased creep\nresistance by generating very ﬁne secondary c¢particles with\nsuitable size and distribution in the cchannels (Ref 8-12). To\nachieve the best results, the temperature and duration of heat\ntreatment must be determined carefully because they affect the\nhardening behavior of these alloys.\nThe aim of this work is to present the results concerning the\nmicrostructural changes in this new niobium-modiﬁed MAR-\nM247 Ni-based superalloy after different aging heat treatments.The results were correlated with simulations using the Thermo-\nCalc and JMatPro softwares.\n2.

The \nCrNbTiVZr  alloy  is composed of body centered cubic ( bcc) and C15 ( face centered cubic ) Laves \nphases while  the Al xCrNbTiVZr (x = 0.25; 0.5; 1) alloys consist of bcc and two C14 ( hexagonal \nclose packed ) Laves phases  with different chemical compositions . Thermodynamic modeling \npredicts  existence  of two phases – bcc and C15 Laves phase and broadening of single bcc phase \nfield due to Al addition. The d ensity  of the alloys decrease s with the increase of Al content. The \nalloys are found to be extremely brittl e at room temperature and 600°C . The alloys  have high \nstrength  at temperatures of 800 -1000°C . For example, yield strength at 800°C increases  from \n440 MPa  for the CrNbTiVZr alloy t o 1250 MPa  for the AlCrNbTiVZr alloy. The experimental \nphase composition of the Al xCrNbTiVZr alloys is compared with predicted  equilibrium phases \nand the factors governing  the transformation  of C15 to C14 Laves phases due to Al addition to \nthe CrNbTiVZr  alloy  analyzed . Specific properties of the alloys are co mpared with other high -\nentropy alloys and commercial Ni -based superalloys.  \nKeywords:  High -entropy alloys ; Crystal structure ; Phase composition ; Laves phase ; Mechanical \nproperties  \n \n \nPage 3:\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n2 \n 1.

Davis \nDepartment of Materials Science and Metallurgy \nUniversity of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 342, United Kingdom \n(Received April 19, 1995) \nThermal cycle simulation techniques have been investigated as a method of studying the effect of cooling \nrate, from sub-solvus solution heat treatment temperatures, on the microstructure and fatigue properties \nof Ni-based superalloy specimens. A Smitweld thermal cycle simulator (TCS) and a Gleeble 1500 TCS \nwere used during the investigation. Grain growth was observed, predominantly in the sample centre, in \na number of specimens simulated using the Smitweld TCS as a result of severe temperature gradients set \nup across the specimen. It is important both to quantify and minimise this temperature gradient, to allow \naccurate heat treatment at the desired temperature. The discrepancy between surface and core \ntemperatures, under different simulation conditions, was determined using three different specimen \ngeometries for internal thermocouple placement. The optimum conditions to minimise the temperature \noverheat were found to be a highly polished specimen surface tested under high vacuum using a small \n(0.15mm) diameter K-type thermocouple for temperature control. The radial temperature distribution in \nthe simulated zone was further investigated by microstructural examination of the supersolvus grain \ngrowth region in a series of samples simulated to a range of peak temperatures. \nI. INTRODUCTION \nThe fatigue crack propagation resistance of Ni-based superalloys is related to the microstructural features \nof the material namely the grain size and y’ size and volume fraction (1). One factor controlling the y’ size \nis the cooling rate after solution heat treatment of the alloy. Thermal cycle simulation allows close control \nof the cooling rate, especially at the crucial temperatures close to the y’ solvus temperature, to be achieved \nin test bars. Hence the effect of cooling rate on y’ size and fatigue properties can be studied. \nThermal cycle simulators (TCS) employ resistance and/or induction heating of the specimen. Cooling \nis achieved using water cooled grips, direct water cooling of specimen ends and/or water or gas quenching \nof the sample surface. During this investigation two simulators, a Smitweld TCS and a Gleeble 1500 TCS, \nwere used to heat treat a Ni-based superalloy. A non uniform temperature profile across the specimen \nthickness was observed during initial trials. Tests were performed to investigate and minimise the \noccurrence of such temperature gradients. \n675 \nPage 2:\n676 THERMAL CYCLE SIMULATION Vol. 34, No. 5 \nFigure 1.

All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\nSince the discovery of a γ0-Co 3(Al, W) phase in the Co –Al–W\nternary [1], signi ﬁcant interest in the phase stabilisation, micro-\nstructural evolution, and mechanical and oxidation behaviours of\nthe aforementioned ternary by multi-alloying has developed [2–\n8]. Because the γ0phase precipitates coherently from the γmatrix,\nthe Co –Al–W ternary material exhibits a microstructure similar to\nthat typical of Ni-based alloys [9,10] . This introduces the coherent\ninterface strengthening mechanism and enhances the high-\ntemperature strength to a level considerably above that of tradi-\ntional Co-based alloys, strengthened only by solid solution ele-\nments and carbides [11,12] .\nFrequently, alloying elements such as Ta, Cr and/or Re, Mo\n[5,7,8,13] have been added to the Co –Al–W ternary to increase\nstrength at room and high temperatures. Systemic research under\ncompressive loading has revealed that with Ta, Cr and/or Re, and\nMo additions, Co –Al–W alloys exhibit excellent ductility and ﬂow\nstress anomalies above 600 1C, whereas the anomalous peak\nstrength values appear at 700 –800 1C. Ta is found to be the most\nefﬁcient strengthening element for a Co –Al–W ternary alloy [2].\nFor example, with the addition of 2 at% Ta, the solvus temperatureof the γ0phase in the Co –9Al–9W alloy increases from 1000 1Cu p\nto 1079 1C, and the compressive strength at 800 1C increases from\n360 to 580 MPa [2,3,7] , for conventional Co-based alloys, this value\nonly /C24300 MPa [3,12] . In addition, strengthening of the grain\nboundaries by precipitates of borides or intermetallic phases has\nbeen found to be critical to the mechanical properties of the γ0-\nstrengthened Co-base superalloys [14,15] , which exhibited even\nbetter creep strength that was comparable to the Ni-base alloy\nIN100.

The plasticity needed is traced to the diﬀerential thermal contractions of the metal and its ceramic mould during processing.\nFor typical cooling rates, the plasticity causing recrystallization is induced above 1000 /C176C, thus over a temperature interval of approx-\nimately 300 /C176C after solidiﬁcation is complete. The total accumulated plastic strain needed for recrystallization is estimated to be in the\nrange of 2–3%. Modelling is used to rationalize the inﬂuence of mould thickness, stress concentration factor and geometry on the inducedplasticity. Negligible plastic strains were predicted in a solid casting with no stress concentration features, as found experimentally. How-\never, recrystallization occurred in thin-walled sections, particularly beneath shroud-like features due to the plasticity induced there.

Introduction\nTurbine blades for gas turbine applications are invest-\nment cast, often into single-crystal form. During process-ing, deformation is induced in the nickel-based superalloyduring solidiﬁcation and subsequent cooling; this is dueto diﬀerential thermal contraction of the metal, mouldand core, arising from their diﬀering thermal expansioncoeﬃcients [1]. In practice, this eﬀect has a number of ram-\niﬁcations which need to be recognized. First, account needs\nto be taken of the shrinkages which occur – the ﬁnal castingwill not exhibit the same dimensions as the wax model towhich it is related. Second, and perhaps of greater practicalimportance, plastic strains are produced which can be largeenough to induce recrystallization during subsequent\nheat treatment [2–5]. Particularly for components cast in\nsingle-crystal form, the occurrence of recrystallizationcannot be tolerated – the associated high-angle grainboundaries degrade the creep [6,7] and fatigue [8–10]\nproperties signiﬁcantly. Work has been done to study therecrystallization behaviour of single-crystal superalloysunder the inﬂuence of diﬀerent annealing conditions [11–13]\nand microstructural features [14–16] . However, very little\nattention has been given to developing a systematic\napproach for design purposes.\nThis paper is concerned with the mathematical model-\nling of the investment casting of single-crystal superalloys,with particular emphasis on thermal–mechanical eﬀects sothat processing-induced plasticity can be predicted andrationalized. One aim is to elucidate the amount of plasticstrain needed for recrystallization to occur, and to infer the\n1359-6454/$36.00 /C2112012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Else"

Introduction\nNi-base superalloys are widely used in manufacturing of gas\nturbine components that require strength at high temperatures. Itis well known that the precipitation of coherent /H9253\n/primephase in the\nmatrix /H9253is responsible for the strength of these materials. The\nmorphology of /H9253/primeprecipitates has been well documented and a\nvariety of shapes have been observed [1–4] . The morphology of\n/H9253/primeparticles depends not only upon the elastic energy associated\nwith the lattice misﬁt between /H9253and/H9253/primebut also upon the nucle-\nation rate [2]. When the initial density of /H9253/primeis high so that the\noverlap of diffusion ﬁelds occurs, the supersaturation is reducedand/H9253\n/primegrows in a stable manner. In this condition the precipitates\nundergoing Ostwald ripening will assume the equilibrium shapesof spheres, cubes, octocubes, aligned cubes, doublets of cubes andplates depending on /H9253\n/primesize, lattice misﬁt and thermal process-\ning conditions [1–3,5,6] . On the other hand, when the nucleation\nrate is low, the precipitates grow to large sizes in the supersatu-rated matrix, developing solid-state morphological instability. Inthis condition, when the misﬁt is high, /H9253\n/primeprecipitates develop cru-\nciform dendrites [2,3] and ﬂower-like dendrites when the misﬁt is\nnearly zero [4,7] .\nThe morphological instability of a nearly spherical particle in a\nsupersaturated matrix was analyzed theoretically by Mullins and\n∗Corresponding author.

DUTTON\nThe plastic-ﬂow behavior which controls the formation of bulk residual stresses during ﬁnal\nheat treatment of powder-metallurgy (PM), nickel-base superalloys was quantiﬁed using con-\nventional (isothermal) stress-relaxation (SR) tests and a novel approach which simulates con-\ncurrent temperature and strain transients during cooling following solution treatment. The\nconcurrent cooling/straining test involves characterization of the thermal compliance of the test\nsample. In turn, this information is used to program the ram-displacement- vs-time proﬁle to\nimpose a constant plastic strain rate during cooling. To demonstrate the eﬃcacy of the new\napproach, SR tests (in both tension and compression) and concurrent cooling/tension-straining\nexperiments were performed on two PM superalloys, LSHR and IN-100. The isothermal SR\nexperiments were conducted at a series of temperatures between 1144 K and 1436 K (871 /C176C\nand 1163 /C176C) on samples that had been supersolvus solution treated and cooled slowly or\nrapidly to produce starting microstructures comprising coarse gamma grains and coarse or ﬁne\nsecondary gamma-prime precipitates, respectively. The concurrent cooling/straining tests\ncomprised supersolvus solution treatment and various combinations of subsequent cooling rate\nand plastic strain rate. Comparison of ﬂow-stress data from the SR and concurrent cooling/\nstraining tests showed some similarities and some diﬀerences which were explained in the\ncontext of the size of the gamma-prime precipitates and the evolution of dislocation substruc-\nture. The magnitude of the eﬀect of concurrent deformation during cooling on gamma-prime\nprecipitation was also quantiﬁed experimentally and theoretically.\nDOI: 10.1007/s11661-015-3033-y\n/C211The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International 2015\nI. INTRODUCTION\nTHEﬁnal heat treatment of nickel-base superalloys\ntypically comprises high-temperature solution treatment\nto dissolve all or most of a strengthening phase (such\nas gamma prime), cooling viawater or oil quenching\nor forced convection, and then lower-temperature\naging.[1,2]In large components of these materials, bulk\nresidual stresses are developed due to small but non-\nuniform plastic strains associated with non-uniform\ncooling following the solution treatment step. In such\ninstances, the surface cools rapidly and tends to shrink,\nbut it is constrained by the hotter interior of thecomponent. The tensile stresses thus developed at the\nsurface relax somewhat by creep-like ﬂow at moderate-\nto-high temperatures. Subsequently, the interior cools\nand tends to shrink from the surface, thereby tending to\ngive rise to largely compressive stresses at the surface\nwhich are balanced by tensile stresses at the interior. The\nresidual stresses so developed may be reduced during the\nsubsequent aging treatment, but usually are not elimi-\nnated. Furthermore, depending on the location of the\nﬁnished component within the heat-treatment envelope,\nclamping, cutter paths, etc., residual-stress patterns may\nalso undergo changes during ﬁnal machining.\nBecause of the complex geometry of typical parts and\nthe spatially-non-uniform nature of the temperature\ntransients, stress patterns, and plastic ﬂow, the quanti-\ntative prediction of residual stresses following solution\nheat treatment typically relies on ﬁnite-element-method\n(FEM) analysis.[3–9]In addition to part geometry"

However,\nthe issues like what is the driving force of precipitation on prior particle boundary (PPB) during consolidationand how the PPB structure evolves during plastic deformation still remain to be resolved. In this study, with the\ncharacterization of the microstructure evolution from powder, consolidation, to plastic deformation, the seg-\nregation of alloying elements on the particle boundaries at elevated temperature was analyzed by equilibriumthermodynamic calculations, and the distortion of PPB structure under large plastic deformation was quanti-\ntively simulated by ﬁnite element (FE) methods. The results indicated that surface energy serves as the main\ndriving force of PPB precipitation and hot extrusion could distort the PPB structure and yield more uniformly\nreﬁned grains.\n1. Introduction\nDue to the excellent comprehensive properties at elevated tem-\nperatures, superalloys have been widely adopted as high temperature\nmaterials for aircraft engines [ 1–8]. In terms of polycrystalline super-\nalloys, powder metallurgy (P/M) is used to produce critical turbinediscs with complex compositions and less elemental macrosegregation\n[3,9–11]. Generally, typical powder metallurgy routes include powder\npreparation and consolidation, some plastic deformation methods likehot extrusion and forging are also employed at speci ﬁc conditions\n[12,13]. Among them, atomization process like argon atomization (AA)\nand plasma rotation electric pole (PREP) are the common techniques to\nyield clean pre-alloyed powders [ 14]; hot isostatic pressing (HIPping) is\nthe a widely used method to consolidate superalloy powder [ 15–18];\nplastic deformation after HIPping, such as hot extrusion and isothermalforging, are mostly utilized to obtain disc parts with desired micro-\nstructure [ 19], for example, hot extrusion after consolidation is used to\nbreak up ceramic inclusions which can adversely impact low cycle fa-tigue (LCF). There is no doubt that direct hot isostatic pressing (as-HIP)\nwould dramatically save costs of producing PM superalloys, but the\nfrequent precipitation on prior particle boundary (PPB) during HIPping\ndetriments the mechanical properties [ 17,20–26].\nThere have been numerous studies on the precipitates on PPB,which were found to consist of oxides, carbides, oxy-carbides, and γ'\nprecipitates [ 18,24,27–32]. Some results also indicated that there were\nsome optional ways to relatively reduce the detrimental e ﬀects of PPB\nprecipitation, such as HIPping at higher temperature and subsequentsupersolvus heat treatment, but these could induce excessive grain\ncoarsening [ 18,25,33–35]. Hence thereafter hot deformations are\nbroadly used to modify the PPB structure and re ﬁne the grains [ 36].\nNevertheless, few of them reported what is the driving force of PPB\np"

Introduction\nDue to their superior mechanical properties at elevated tem-\nperature, nickel-based superalloys are favoured for applications inrotating discs in gas turbine engines. Modelling of fatigue [1–3] ,\ncreep [4,5] and fatigue–creep interaction [6–10] of nickel alloys\nhas been carried out using a variety of analytical and numeri-cal approaches, including so-called uniﬁed constitutive models. Inthese models, plastic and creep strains were represented by oneinelastic strain to simulate the viscoplastic behaviour of materi-als. One of the most popular uniﬁed models, the uniﬁed Chabochemodel, has been adopted by Tong and Vermeulen [11] successfully\nto simulate the cyclic behaviour with and without short strain-holdperiods for a wrought nickel-based superalloy, Waspaloy. Thereare typically a large number of materials parameters associatedwith the model to be determined using the experimental data,hence the model behaviour critically depends on the experimentaldata from which the model parameters are calibrated, the qual-ity of the experimental data were shown [12] to be important. A\ndynamic recovery variable was found useful in the description ofcyclic stress relaxation [13,14] ; while plastic strain memory was\nalso incorporated in the uniﬁed model [15] to improve the simula-\ntion of isotropic hardening.

Rojhirunsakool •S. Meher •J. Y. Hwang •\nS. Nag •J. Tiley •R. Banerjee\nReceived: 11 April 2012 / Accepted: 13 August 2012 / Published online: 29 August 2012\n/C211Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012\nAbstract This study investigates the inﬂuence of alloy\ncomposition on c0precipitation in Ni–8Al–8Cr and Ni–10Al–\n10Cr at.% during continuous cooling from a supersolvustemperature. When subjected to the same cooling rate,\nNi–8Al–8Cr develops a monomodal population, whereas\nNi–10Al–10Cr develops a multimodal (primarily bimodal)population of c\n0precipitates. The bimodal c0precipitate size\ndistribution in Ni–10Al–10Cr alloy can be attributed to two\nsuccessive nucleation bursts during continuous cooling whilethe monomodal c\n0size distribution in Ni–8Al–8Cr results\nfrom a single nucleation burst followed by a longer time—\nwider temperature window for nucleation resulting in a largernumber density of precipitates. Three-dimensional atom\nprobe investigations reveal that while local equilibrium is\nachieved across the c/c\n0interface, far-ﬁeld ccompositions still\nretain an excess of Al and a depletion of Cr with respect to\nequilibrium, thus giving direct experimental evidence of the\ndriving force for subsequent nucleation bursts during con-tinuous cooling in case of Ni–10Al–10Cr. Contrastingly, in\ncase of the Ni–8Al–8Cr alloy, while the cphase retains an\nexcess of Al and a depletion of Cr with respect to equilibrium\nafter continuous cooling to room temperature, the additional\ndriving force is consumed during subsequent isothermalannealing by growth of the large number of c\n0precipitates\nwithout any new nucleation.\nIntroduction\nNi–Al–Cr forms the basis of many technologically important\nand commercially used Ni-base s uperalloys. The microstruc-\nture primarily consists of ﬁnely dispersed precipitates of the\nordered c0phase, with the L1 2structure, within a disordered\nface-centered cubic cmatrix. The c–c0microstructure in these\nalloys can be controlled via a combination of composition and\ncooling rate from the high temperature single cphase ﬁeld\nduring processing. The resulting morphology and size distri-\nbution of c0precipitates determine the mechanical properties of\nthese alloys [ 1,2]. Microstructural evolution in Ni–Al–Cr\nsystem is strongly dependent o n the solute concentration.\nIncrease in Al content increases the c0solvus temperature,\nwhereas increase in Cr content typically decreases the c0solvus\ntemperature [ 3,4]. The inﬂuence of cooling rate on c0precip-\nitation has been extensively inv estigated. Faster cooling rates\nfrom supersolvus temperatures, t ypically lead to the formation\nof a monomodal size distribution of reﬁned c0precipitates\n[5–7]. In contrast, relatively slower cooling rates lead to the\nformation of c0precipitates with a bimodal size distribution or\nin some cases even a multim odal size distribution [ 5,8–12].\nThe development of multiple size ranges of c0precipitates\nduring continuous cooling has often been attributed to multiple\ndistinct nucleation bursts at di fferent undercoolings below the\nc0solvus [ 8–10]. These multiple nucleation bursts in turn result\nfrom the complex interplay of continuously increasing ther-\nmodynamic driving force for nucleation (chemical free energy\ndifference) due to increasing undercooling, reduction in thisdriving force due to previous nuc leation events, and, the rapidly\ndeclining diffusivity of alloying elements with decreasingT.

The directionally \nsolidified CoNi-base superalloy possesses a lower d ensity of 9.03 g/cm 3 and a higher \nγʹ solvus temperature of 1166 °C, compared with those  of the Co-Al-W-base \nsuperalloys with high level of W element. After agi ng at 900-1100 °C, the alloy \ndisplays stable γ/γʹ two-phase microstructure with high volume fraction  of the γʹ phase, \nand without detrimental topologically close-packed (TCP) phase. The CoNi-base \nPage 3:\nMANUSCRIPT \nACCEPTED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n2 \n superalloy shows good compression property. In the process of compression, the alloy \nexhibits positive temperature dependence of the 0.2 % flow stress above 600 °C. With \nincreasing temperature, the alloy displays a maximu m of 0.2% flow stress of 607 MPa \nat 850 °C. The major deformation mechanisms of the CoNi-base alloy are pairs of \na/2<110>-type dislocations shearing γʹ precipitates from room temperature to 850 °C \nand unpaired dislocations bypassing the γʹ precipitates above the peak temperature of \n850 °C. In this alloy, high content of Ni improves the γʹ solvus temperature and \nmicrostructural stability, which leads to a good co mpression property at high \ntemperatures. \nKeywords: CoNi-base superalloy; directional solidif ication; micr"

These high-value single-crystal \nblades are nonetheless subjected to sur -\nface damage and cracking upon extensive service in harsh environments. It is thus critical to find a way to repair the damaged surface while keeping their single-crystal-\nline nature as well as the desired uniform \nγ/γ ′ microstructure. Such a successful \nrepair will extend the life of turbine blades \nand reduce the overall cost significantly.\nThe versatile 3D-printing technique \nemerging in recent years appears to be a powerful route toward this goal.\n[3] Via “epi-\ntaxial” deposition of the alloy, one layer at a time, additive manufacturing can pre-\nserve the crystallographic orientation of \nthe substrate single crystal.\n[4–11] However, \nas 3D printing involves fast cooling, the γ′ \nprecipitates are either undetectable[12] or \nexcessively small with uneven sizes and rounded corners\n[13,14] and hence less stable \nduring high-temperature service. At some superalloy compositions and 3D-printing parameters, detrimental Laves phase par -\nticles are reported.\n[15] More importantly, \na high density of dislocations build up in the heat-affected zone (HAZ), due to una-\nvoidable (often local) deformation under high thermal stresses during printing.\n[16,17] Upon solution treatment at elevated \ntemperatures, these regions riddled with dislocations readily undergo recrystallization (RX)\n[18] that renders the microstruc-\nture polycrystalline, which would significantly degrade the high-temperature creep performance of blades (Figure S1 in The repair of damaged Ni-based superalloy single-crystal turbine blades \nhas been a long-standing challenge. Additive manufacturing by an electron \nbeam is promising to this end, but there is a formidable obstacle: either the \nresidual stress and γ/γ  ′ microstructure in the single-crystalline fusion zone \nafter e-beam melting are unacceptable (e.g., prone to cracking), or, after \nsolutionizing heat treatment, recrystallization occurs, bringing forth new \ngrains that degrade the high-temperature creep properties. Here, a post-3D printing recovery protocol is designed that eliminates the driving force for \nrecrystallization, namely, the stored energy associated with the high retained \ndislocation density, prior to standard solution treatment and aging. The post-electron-beam-melting, pre-solutionizing recovery via sub-solvus annealing \nis rendered possible by the rafting (i.e., directional coarsening) of \nγ  ′ parti-\ncles that facilitates dislocation rearrangement and annihilation. The rafted microstructure is removed in subsequent solution treatment, leaving behind \na damage-free and residual-stress-free single crystal with uniform \nγ  ′ pre-\ncipitates indistinguishable from the rest of the turbine blade. This discovery \noffers a practical means to keep 3D-printed single crystals from cracking \ndue to unrelieved residual stress, or stress-relieved but recrystallizing into a polycrystalline microstructure, paving the way for additive manufacturing to \nrepair, restore, and reshape any superalloy single-crystal product.\nModern turbine blades are made of superalloy single crystals, \nstrengthened by cuboidal precipitates of ordered γ ′-phase in \nthe γ -phase matrix.[1] Single-crystal Ni-based superalloys out-\nperform t"

In order to keep pace with increasingly demanding design requirements associated \nwith advanced gas turbine technologies, the properties of Ni-base superalloys can be greatly enhanced via thermo-\nmechanical and/or compositional changes. Recent studies have revealed that ternary eutectic /g534-/g534’-/g303 Ni-base \nsuperalloys exhibit promising high temperature mechanical properties that may potentially be superior to state-of-the-art polycrystalline Ni-base superalloys that are currently used in advanced gas turbines. As the properties of this \nnovel class of alloys are largely dependent on microstructural strengthening mechanisms, both the composition and \nthermo-mechanical processing parameters need to be optimized concurrently. Deformation at temperatures and strain rates between 1040/g219C to 1140/g219C and 0.1/s to 0.001/s resulted in a transition of dominant deformation mechanisms from dislocation based plasticity to grain boundary rotation and sliding. The governing deformation mechanism was found to influence the alignment of /g303 phase precipitates and the degree of anisotropy that occurs \nduring hot deformation of /g534-/g534’-/g303 Ni-base superalloys. Coupling high deformation temperatures with low strain rates \npromotes grain boundary sliding and rotation leading to less internal cavitation damage and a more isotropic microstructure.  \nIntroduction \nNickel-base superalloys exhibit an excellent combination of properties that make them ideal for service at \nelevated temperatures and corrosive environments [1-4].

Introduction\nDue to the high cost of single crystalline (SX) nickel-base\nsuperalloy components the development of joining techniques forturbine blades and the development of repair processes for fatiguecracks is a worthwhile goal. Research on the applicability of tran-sient liquid phase bonding (TLP) for joining and repair of suchmaterials has shown a high potential of this method for both pur-poses [1,2] . TLP-bonding is a process where gap closure is achieved\nby isothermal solidiﬁcation of the braze. The solidiﬁcation takesplace due to the outward diffusion of the so called melting pointdepressing element, which lowers the melting point of the brazealloy. By diffusion into the base material the melting point of theliquid braze increases at the solid liquid interface and the mate-rial solidiﬁes. By this process the brazing zone can solidify fullyfrom outward to inward when enough time is allowed for the dif-\n∗Corresponding author at: Department of Materials Science & Metallurgy, Uni-\nversity of Cambridge, UTC, Pembroke Street, Cambridge CB2 3QZ, United Kingdom.Tel.: +44 01223 334367; fax: +44 01223 331956.\nE-mail address: sn367@cam.ac.uk (S.

Amaro1, Stephen D. Antolovich*,2,3,4, Richard W. Neu2,3 and \nPreet M. Singh3\nSingle-crystal Ni-base superalloys are a favoured material for blades in the hot section of aero turbines. \nThese materials exhibit excellent dimensional stability, deformation response and oxidation behaviour \nat higher temperatures, relative to other metals. Due to the high service temperatures and fluctuating \nloads experienced by turbine blades, a complete understanding of the material’s oxidation and γ′ \ndepletion kinetics is sought to characterise this aspect of the material’s deformation response. This work provides the results and subsequent analysis of stress-free γ′ depletion tests performed on the \nsingle-crystal Ni-base superalloy PWA 1484. It was determined that the γ′ depletion kinetics of this \nmaterial followed a sub-parabolic rate law. Furthermore, γ′ depletion kinetics were dependent upon \nsurface roughness. Surface roughness can be an issue in practical application of oxidation principles \nand data. A relationship is developed, based on the literature and current work, which relates the \nstress-free γ′ depletion kinetics to exposure temperature, time and surface roughness.\nKeywords: Oxidation kinetics, γ′ depletion, Surface roughness, PWA 1484\nIntroduction\nNi-base superalloys consist primarily of a two phase micro-\nstructure comprised of a γ matrix and γ′ precipitates along \nwith secondary phases such as carbides. While the precip-\nitates have the Ni3Al (L12) crystal structure, the matrix is \naustenitic with a high Ni concentration and other elements \nadded for specific purposes (e.g. to confer oxidation resist-\nance, to control the γ/γ′ mismatch, to provide solid solution \nstrengthening, etc.). Given the strong affinity for Ni and Al to \nform the precipitate, there is a minimal aluminium content in γ matrix. When exposed to high temperatures the Al diffuses \nfrom the γ′ phase toward the material surface, forming an \noxide or oxides, according to the thermodynamic stability of \nthe oxides in question.1 Once the aluminium diffuses from the \nγ′ precipitates, their stability is greatly reduced and a denuded \nzone is formed which is effectively 100% γ matrix. As the precipitates provide the primary strengthening mechanism \nfor the alloy at temperatures above ~373 K (100 °C),\n2 the \nγ′ depleted zone resulting from high temperature exposure creates a softer subsurface region which is then susceptible \nto further damage at high temperatures.\nThe majority of the superalloy oxidation studies to date \nare pred"

The dissolution kinetics of the ordered phase Ni 3(Al, Ti, Nb, Ta) upon heating\nto the solutioning temperature of /C241200 /C176C and its reprecipitation on cooling are deduced; eﬀects of varying Nb and Ti alloy composition on the\nreaction kinetics are identiﬁed. Heating to 800 /C176C does not alter substantially the fraction of the strengthening phase Ni 3(Al, Ti, Nb, Ta) but further\nheating causes its rapid dissolution. At higher temperatures, evidence is provided for the formation of further ordered phases; Ni 3(Ti, Ta) is proposed\nand possibly Ni 0.45Ta0.55; cooling causes their dissolution and reprecipitation of Ni 3(Al, Ti, Nb, Ta), so that it seems probable that the reactions are\ncoupled. The unforeseen high temperature precipitation of further ordering by phases other than Ni 3(Al, Ti, Nb, Ta) implies the possibility of a con-\ntribution by them to the high temperature mechanical behaviour of these materials, which until now has been thought to be solely due to Ni 3(Al, Ti,\nNb, Ta). The MC carbide, probably TiC, is stable even at the solution heat treatment temperature; no evidence of reactions involving other carbidessuch as M\n23C6is found.\n/C2112015 Acta Materialia Inc.

Introduction\nEngineering alloys – for example those based upon Al,\nFe, Ni and Ti – rely upon a phase transition to confer opti-\nmised properties. For the nickel-based superalloys one uses\nan ordering reaction involving long-range diﬀusion totransform the cmatrix phase to precipitates of compound\nNi\n3(Al, Ti, Nb, Ta), denoted as c0, with an L1 2crystal struc-\nture. Dislocations cannot enter the precipitates easily; pla-nar defects such as anti-phase boundaries and complex\nstacking faults of high energy arise if they do, resulting in\nconsiderable strengthening. This is the primary source ofthe excellent high temperature performance of these alloys\n[1].\nThe size, distribution and morphology of these c0precip-\nitates must be carefully controlled during processing heat\ntreatments to optimise the mechanical performance of the\nnickel-based superalloy. To ensure this carefully tailoredmicrostructure does not change when it is subjected to ele-\nvated temperatures in service, the lattice misﬁt between the\ncand c\n0phases must be minimised to retain interfacial\ncoherency. The addition of refractory elements, primarily\nadded to confer high temperature strength, heavilyinﬂuences the lattice parameters of the corc0phases which\nthey partition to [2,3], directly aﬀecting lattice misﬁt. This\nsensitivity of element partitioning to each phase isfurther inﬂuenced by processing heat treatments, and in\nparticular, cooling rates "

The thermo-\ndynamic description of the Al-Co-W system including all three binaries was developed considering thermo-dynamic and constitutional data of the systems. Results from density functional theory calculations were em-\nployed to improve reliability of the descriptions. The Gibbs energy for the thermal vacancy (G\nVa) in the BCC_A2\nphase is discussed. The revised descriptions obtained for the Al-W and Co-W systems describe the thermo-\ndynamic and phase equilibrium data well and are free of undesired artefacts for temperatures below 6000 K. Theordered γ’phase of the Al-Co-W system is described as a metastable phase in the entire temperature range. The\ncalculated Gibbs energy of the γ’is only slightly above that of the equilibrium state, which indicates that there is\ngood possibility of stabilizing the γ’phase with the addition of γ’-stabilizing elements, such as Ti, Ta, Hf, Nb and\nNi.\n1. Introduction\nSuperalloys are used in aircraft engines, turbo superchargers and\nchemical plants that require high performance at elevated temperatures\n[1–3]. The most widely used superalloys are Ni-based alloys which are\nstrengthened by γ’phase (L1 2, AlNi 3) while traditional Co-based alloys,\nlacking this phase, have limited applications due to their lower high-\ntemperature strength. The e ﬃciency of gas turbine cycles increases\nwith increasing turbine inlet temperature, thus continuous e ﬀorts are\nmade to increase the γ’solvus temperature of Ni-based alloys, such as\nthe addition of γ’stabilizing elements. Although these Ni-based super-\nalloys have a very high ratio of absolute working temperature to\nmelting temperature, the higher melting point of Co compared to Ni\nmakes Co-based alloys attractive candidates for high temperature ap-\nplications. In addition, Co-based alloys are receiving more attention\nbecause of the potential for superior hot corrosion resistance, better\nweldability and thermal fatigue resistance compared to Ni-based su-\nperalloys [4]. The key for the application of Co-based alloys as super-\nalloys is improving their high-temperature strength. Already in 1971,Lee[5]found that a Co-0.04 Al-0.25 W alloy (mass fraction) with or-\ndered γ’phase (L1\n2) precipitates in a γphase matrix (FCC_A1) exhibited\nprecipitation-hardened characteristics. More recent work by Sato et al.[6]found that Al-Co-W alloys showed increased high-temperaturestrength compared to conventional Ni-base superalloys as result of γ’\nprecipitates in a γmatrix. This suggested a promising future for the\napplication of Co-based γ/γ’superalloys. However, subsequent experi-\nments showed that the ternary γ’phase Co\n3(Al,W) "

Introduction\nThe critical structural components in the helium gas-cooled\nhigh-temperature reactor, such as heat exchanger and primary-\nto-secondary piping, are predicted to operate at 1000 /C176C in corro-\nsive environments for extended periods of time [1–6] . Several\nNi-base alloys such as Inconel 617, Haynes 230, Alloy 800H, Alloy\nXR and the Ni–Cr–W have been considered as potential high-tem-\nperature materials for such reactor applications [7–22] . The princi-\nples of strengthening and creep-resistance in these alloys involve\neither precipitation hardening by ordered c0(Ni 3Al) phase or solid\nsolution strengthening by Mo, Ru, Ta, W and Re refractory ele-ments, or both [23–26] . Due to the higher density of some of these\nelements, limited quantities are used in alloys for turbine airfoil\napplications. However, since these elements possess very low\ndiffusion coefﬁcients and have been shown to be quite effective\nin improving creep resistance [25,27,28] , higher levels of refractory\nalloying additions would be desirable for ground-based reactor\napplications. It should be noted that two-phase\nc/c0Ni-alloys\nmay not be suitable for long service time applications due to the\nlikelihood of strength degradation via c0coarsening. Therefore, al-\nloys typically selected for the reactor applications are single-phase\nc-Ni and derive their strengthening from solution hardening. Due\nto the low amount of Al (in order to avoid c0precipitation), the\nmaterials are alloyed with sufﬁcient Cr in order to form chromia\n(Cr2O3) at high temperatures. In the current study, four experimen-\ntal Ni-based alloys solid solution strengthened by Co, Mo, Re andW were utilized. Additionally, Al and Cr were added for protective\nsurface oxide growth, although the alloys are predominantly\nchromia (Cr 2O3) formers. Unlike the alloys such as Inconel 617\n(20–25 wt.% Cr), the Cr content has been reduced to /C2412–15 wt.%\nin order to avoid brittle topologically close packed (TCP) phase for-\nmation in combination with high Re and W.\nAfter steady-state operation, the helium coolant in secondary\nheat exchanger loops contains impurities such as H 2/H2O, CO/\nCO2,C H 4and N 2at low concentration levels (ppm) due to degas-\nsing, leakages and reactions (oxidation and cracking) from the\ngraphite core and among other materials [5,29–33] .

Thus, searching for the optimum cooling rate remains a critical researchtopic to maximize the mechanical performance. Previously, the “one sample, one experiment ”approach is\nadopted for this optimization process, which is very costly and time-consuming. Here we demonstrate a high-throughput method to produce a gradient distribution of γ' precipitates within an individual specimen by\nintroducing a wide range of cooling rates. The microscopic examinations show that the smallest average particle\nsize of γ' phases corresponds to the fastest cooling rate, and vice versa. Unexpectedly, a two-stage distribution of\nVickers hardness is observed, which is contradictive with the previous results and mechanistically explained by\nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Our results shed new insights on understanding the relationship betweencooling rates and mechanical properties in polycrystalline nickel base superalloy.\n1. Introduction\nPowder metallurgy nickel base superalloy is renowned for its\nsuperior capabilities with an excellent combination of high temperature\nstrength, creep and fatigue resistance [1–4]. These striking mechanical\nproperties are inherently associated with the size distribution, mor-phology and volume fraction of γ' precipitates. Previous literatures have\nextensively documented that the solution cooling rate together withaging time act a critical role in tailoring these microscopic features of γ'\nprecipitates [5–10]. The nucleation, growth, coarsening, morphology,\nsize distribution and volume fraction of γ' precipitates are strongly\ndependent on the solution cooling rate based on experiment results[5,7,11] and phase ﬁeld calculation [12]. Furthermore, the composi-\ntional variations of di ﬀerent generation γ'[13] and di ﬀusion kinetics\nfor diﬀerent alloy elements [11] can be signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuenced by the\nsolution cooling rates. Both theoretic calculation [14,15] and experi-\nmental results [16] have shown that a smaller average particle size of γ'\nprecipitates could increase yield strength comparing with the counter-parts with the same volume fraction, particularly emphasizing the role\nof nano-sized tertiary γ'. The proportional relationship between cooling\nrate and Vickers hardness/yield strength is summarized in Fig. 1[7,8,17 –22]. However, this “one sample, one experiment ”approach is\ncostly and labor-intensive. Moreover, the process inevitably su ﬀers\nfrom the variation of chemical composition and microstructure ﬂuctua-\ntion in the processing. Therefore, it is highly essential to realize the\nstructure characterization within an individual specimen, wherein the\ncooling rate is the sole variable.\nIn th"

Isother-mal compression tests were carried out on electron beam weldments FGH4096-GH4133B alloy at the\ntemperatures of 1020–11140 /C176C (the nominal\nc0-transus temperature is about 1080 /C176C) and the strain\nrates of 0.001–1.0 s/C01with the height reduction of 50%. True stress–true strain curves are sensitive to\nthe deformation temperature and strain rate, and the ﬂow stress decreases with the increasing deforma-\ntion temperature and the decreasing strain rate. The true stress–true strain curves can indicate the intrin-\nsic relationship between the ﬂow stress and the thermal-dynamic behavior. The apparent activationenergy of deformation at the strain of 0.6 was calculated to be 550 kJ/mol, and the apparent activation\nenergy has a great effect on the microstructure. The constitutive equation that describes the ﬂow stress\nas a function of strain rate and deformation temperature was proposed for modeling the hot deformationprocess of FGH4096-GH4133B electron beam weldments. The constitutive equation at the strain of 0.6was established using the hyperbolic law. The relationship between the strain and the values of param-\neters was studied, and the cubic functions were built. The constitutive equation during the whole process\ncan be obtained based on the parameters under different strains.

Introduction\nGH4133B alloy (Ni–20.0Cr–2.5Ti–1.5Nb–1.0Al) is a traditional\nNi-base superalloy, and it has good microstructure stability, excel-\nlent mechanical properties, good ultimate strength and creep per-formance at elevated temperature. This alloy has been widely\napplied for manufacturing turbine engine blades and other bearing\ncomponents under a high temperature [1]. This alloy as a tradi-\ntional superalloy has been used for a number of years, and its suit-\nable service temperature is about 700 /C176C. With the continuous\ndevelopment of modern aviation industry, the working tempera-\nture for aircraft engine disk increased, the traditional Ni-based\nsuperalloy cannot meet the necessary for high temperature struc-\ntural components.\nPowder metallurgy (PM) superalloy is a new type of alloys, It\nhas been developed rapidly for its excellent performance. At pres-ent, there are two generations of powder metallurgy superalloys\nwhich have been used in practice [2]. The ﬁrst generation PM\nsuperalloy has ﬁne grains, high strength and high crack propaga-\ntion rate.

Introduction\nThere has been a recent progress in the development and\nutilisation of in-situ techniques to study the microstructural\nphase transformations (PTs) in inorganic materials. SynchrotronX-ray diffraction (XRD) has been successfully used in severalstudies to in-situ investigate the phase evolution in reciprocal\nspace during melting and solidification (e.g. [1]), despite the\ntechnical difficulties associated with heating during in-situ\ndiffraction. Nonetheless, in-situ XRD does not enable the direct\nobservation of the microstructural mechanisms during melting\nand solidification (e.g. grain boundary or second-phase particle\nmelting), especially when kinetic phenomena (rapid heatingcycles) are being observed. Similarly, variations in the enthalpyor electrical resistivity can be used to study the PTs using dif-ferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) or electrical conductivitymeasurements, respectively. However, they are generally limitedto heating and cooling rates close to equilibrium conditions (upto ~1 °C/s), although new advanced DSC furnaces have beendesigned to achieve rates greater than 100 °C/s [2],y e tw i t h o u t\nthe possibility of real-time observation of the microstructure.\nIn high-temperature materials (e.g. steel, titanium, and Ni-\nbased superalloys), PTs normally occur at temperatures above~700 °C for solid –solid PTs, up to 1300 –1600 °C for solid –liquid\nPTs. These temperatures pose major concerns when usingsimple in-situ observation setups (e.g. light optical microscopy\nusing a hot stage) due to the possibility of oxidation, as well asthermal emission either from the heating element or thespecimen, which ultimately lead to a poor image quality [3].\nOver the past decade, high-temperature confocal laser scan-\nning microscopy (HT-CLSM) has been used in several studies\ninvestigating both the solid –solid PTs [4,5] and solid –liquid PTs\n[6,7]. HT-CLSM utilises the advantages of laser (high coherence\nand monochromaticity), confocal optics, halogen lamp heat-ing, and infrared image furnace (IIF) to produce focussedimages showing the PT seq"

Introduction\nThe new generation of coal- ﬁred power plants, termed\nadvanced ultra-supercritical (A-USC) coal- ﬁred power plants, have\nbeen designed to operate at higher steam temperatures (700/C14C)\nand higher steam pressures (37.5 MPa) than current generation\nultra-super-critical (USC) plants, which operate around 600/C14C and\n24 MPa [1e6]. It is projected that A-USC boilers will achieve above\n50% process ef ﬁciency over current generation plants and are ex-\npected to release 40 e50% less CO 2than current generation boilers\n[7]. Novel materials, such as advanced ferritic and austenitic steels,\nNi-based superalloys and thermal barrier coatings, have contrib-\nuted signi ﬁcantly to increase the ef ﬁciency of fossil-fueled power\nplants for reducing the emission of greenhouse gases and\nimproving energy conservation [8e12]. Special requirements have\nbeen proposed for the materials used in A-USC boiler according to\nthe operating conditions, i.e. 100,000 h creep strength greater than\n100 MPa at 750/C14C and 200,000 h coal-ash corrosion resistance ofless than 2 mm metal loss [13]. These conditions disqualify ferritic\nand austenitic steels because their temperature capacities are\naround 680/C14C[7,13,14] . Thus, much attention has turned to the g0\nprecipitation strengthened Ni-based alloys, such as Inconel740/\n740H (Ni e25Cre20Coe0.5Mo e2Tie2Nbe0.9Al, wt%) [8,15] ,\nCCA617 (Ni e22Cre11Coe3We8Moe1.2Al, wt%) [9,16,17] , Haynes\n282 (Ni e20Cre10Coe8.5Mo e2.1Tie1.5Al, wt%) [10] and\nNimonic263 (Ni e20Cre20Coe6Moe2Tie0.6Al, wt%) [11]. These\nNi-based alloys have good long term creep strength and good\ncorrosion resistance, which are thought to be the promising can-\ndidates for high temperature components in the most severe re-\ngions of A-USC power plants. However, they are prohibitively\nexpensive due to a high content of Co (10 e20 wt %) and/or Mo and\nW( 6e8 wt %).\nA low cost austenitic Ni eFe-based alloy"

The fully solutionized specimens reveal formation of single \nphase FCC  phase.  The artificially aged alloy consists  of Ni and Al rich FCC α (L1 2) \nprecipitate in FCC (γ) matrix.

The change of coherency state, e.g., loss of coherency, can aﬀect the\nprecipitation kinetics and the eﬃcacy of precipitate hardening. In this work, we predict the\ncritical size of c00-Ni3Nb precipitates in IN718 to trigger coherency loss using the phase-ﬁeld\napproach with available materials parameters from ﬁrst-principles calculations and from the\nliterature. The predicted critical size lies within the range of experimentally reported values. The\neﬀect of coherency loss on precipitate morphology and kinetics, as well as the aging time to\nreach this critical size during heat treatment, is also predicted and discussed. These predictions\nprovide guidance in controlling the size of c00precipitates and optimizing the strength of IN718\nalloys.\nDOI: 10.1007/s11661-016-3480-0\n/C211The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International 2016\nI. INTRODUCTION\nPRECIPITATE hardening is one of the key strength-\nening mechanisms in various alloys. Through precipitate\nreactions, the precipitates, either shearable or shear-re-\nsistant, can act as obstacles of dislocation motion in the\nalloy matrix, enhancing the strength of alloys. The\neﬃcacy of precipitate hardening is largely determined by\nthe coherency state of the precipitates within the\nmatrix.[1]When the precipitate is coherent with the\nmatrix phase, i.e., when there are well-deﬁned lattice\ncorrespondence (LC) and orientation relationship (OR)\nbetween the crystal structures of the precipitate and the\nmatrix, and the misﬁt strains between the two phases are\nwithin the elastic range, then precipitate hardening is the\nmost eﬀective. In contrast, when the precipitates are\nsemi-coherent or incoherent with the matrix phase, i.e.,\nwhen crystal structures of the precipitate and the matrix\npartially ﬁt or do not ﬁt at all, line defects (such as\ndislocations and structure ledges) can develop at the\nprecipitate/matrix interface, and the eﬀect of precipitate\nhardening is impaired.\nInitially coherent precipitates can lose coherency\nduring continued growth when the elastic strain energy\nbecomes dominant. The elastic energy density is higherfor coherent phase than the incoherent one, i.e., the\nelastic energy function is a penalty term for the\nprecipitation process and it scales with the volume of\nthe precipitates. When the precipitate reaches a critical\nsize, the coherent phase becomes energetically unfavor-\nable. Consequently, line defects on the precipitate/ma-\ntrix interfaces are developed to relax the stresses arising\nfrom misﬁt, which lead to coherency loss. This type of\ncoherency loss has been observed in many diﬀerent types\nof alloys, including h0precipitates in Al-Cu-based\nalloys,[2]c0andc00precipitates in Ni-based alloys,[2,3]\nandb¢precipitates in Al-Mg-Si alloys.[2]\nThe theoretical analysis of the mechanisms of coher-\nency loss of a growing particle has been established by\nWeatherly et al.[2]Three mechanisms have been pro-\nposed: (i) the punching of dislocation loops near the\nprecipitate/matrix interface due to coherency stresses in\nthe matrix, (ii) the climb of dislocations from the matrix,\nand (iii) the nucleation of dislocation loops inside a\nprecipitate. For each of these mechanisms, there is a\ncorrelation between the dimensions of the precipitate and\nthe amount of dislocations at the interface, indicating a\ncritical siz"

Introduction\nSelective  Laser  Melting  process  (SLM)  has  recently  emerged  and\nis  based  upon  the  stereolithography  technology  which  allows  to\nproduce  prototypes  by  building  it  layer  after  layer  in  a  pool  of\nphoto-sensible  resin. In the case of SLM, ﬁne metallic powder layers\n(25–50  /H9262m)  are  spread  out  on  the  building  platform.  According  to\nthe  initial  CAD  (Computer  aided  Design)  ﬁle,  the  laser  beam  scans\neach  layer in order to locally melt the powder particles and form a\nmelting  pool which is instantaneously solidiﬁed as the laser beam\nmoves  forwards.  Due  to  the  small  laser  beam  diameter,  the  proto-\ntypes  can  now  contain  speciﬁc  features  such  as  cooling  channels  or\nvery  thin  details  (/similarequal200  /H9262m  in  thickness)  in  very  short  times  because\nthe  process  does  not  involve  the  use  of  expensive  tools.  Obviously,\nthe  powder  not  affected  by  the  heat  coming  from  the  laser  can\nmostly  be  recycled  for  further  use.\n∗Corresponding author  at:  Mines  ParisTech,  Materials  Centre,  Rue  Henri  Des-\nbruères,\n 91003  Evry,  France.

POLLOCK\nPolycrystalline c-c¢superalloys with varying grain sizes and unimodal, bimodal, or trimodal\ndistributions of precipitates have been studied. To assess the contributions of speciﬁc features of\nthe microstructure to the overall strength of the material, a model that considers solid-solutionstrengthening, Hall–Petch eﬀects, precipitate shearing in the strong and weak pair-coupled\nmodes, and dislocation bowing between precipitates has been developed and assessed.

New experimental observations on the contribution of\nprecipitate shearing to the peak in ﬂow stress at elevated temperatures are presented. Various\nalloys having comparable yield strengths were investigated and were found to derive theirstrength from diﬀerent combinations of microconstituents (mechanisms). In all variants of themicrostructure, there is a strong eﬀect of antiphase boundary (APB) energy on strength.\nMaterials subjected to heat treatments below the c¢solvus temperature beneﬁt from a strong\nHall–Petch contribution, while supersolvus heat-treated materials gain the majority of theirstrength from their resistance to precipitate shearing.\nDOI: 10.1007/s11661-009-9858-5\n/C211The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International 2009\nI. INTRODUCTION\nPOLYCRYSTALLINE nickel-base superalloys are\ncapable of maintaining strength in excess of 1 GPa attemperatures up to 800 /C176C. Because of this, these\nsuperalloys are widely used in aircraft engines and\npower generation turbines as turbine blade and diskmaterials. The ever-present drive to improve perfor-\nmance and eﬃciency by operating engines at increas-\ningly higher temperatures has led to the continualdevelopment of new alloys that retain their strength athigher temperatures.\nTraditionally, in the design of new superalloys, the\ncompositions of existing alloys and the speciﬁc featuresof processing are incrementally changed to achieve\nimproved properties. Extensive mechanical testing isthen required to determine the extent of the improve-\nment. Although this process has resulted in many useful\nalloys, it is expensive and time consuming; the design\nprocess could beneﬁt from a greater contribution ofprocess and property modeling.\nCommercial polycrystalline superalloys that are used\nfor turbine disk alloys possess complex microstructures\nthat are optimized for a range of mechanical proper-ties.\n[1–4]Typical premium wrought nickel-base superal-\nloys consist of a cmatrix that contains up to three\ndiﬀerent size distributions (approximately 0.01, 0.1, and1.0lm in diameter) of L1\n2(ordered fcc) c¢precipitates.\nThe smaller two populations of precipitates are coherent\nwith the cmatrix, while high-angle boundaries exist\nbetween the micron-sized c¢precipitates and the c\nmatrix. Due to the presence of ordered Ni 3Al precipi-\ntates, the strength of these alloys often increases between\nroom temperature and 800 /C176C. These nickel-base super-\nalloys also have excellent creep properties.[5,6]\nGiven the presence of ordered precipitates and the\nexceptional strength of this class of materials, superal-loys have been the subject of a range of analytical\nmodels for strengthening.[7–13]A feature of virtually all\nof these models is that they consider simple microstruc-tures in which only one or two strengthening mecha-\nnisms are active.

Introduction\nOwing to the elimination of the grain boundaries perpendicular to the main stress axis, directionally solidiﬁed (DS) and\nsingle crystal (SC) superalloys have excellent mechanical properties, such as high heat resistance, fatigue strength, creep\nstrength and vibration damping ability, and have been introduced into most of the advanced aero-engines.\nAn aero-engine failed with the rotational speed declining suddenly from 52,000 r/min to 51,700 r/min and vibration enlarg-\ning abnormally during testing. After checking, it was found that two rotor blades fractured. There were totally 39 same rotary\nblades as these two. None of the blades was found to have tip rubbing trace. Some of the blades were found to have collision\ntrace. These blades are made of a SC superalloy, and the bodies of the blades are covered with coating. In the present work,\nthe fracture cause and mode of the failed blades were analyzed, and some prevention measures for such failure were proposed.\n2.

Experimental results showed that smaller precipitates\n(∼50 nm), obtained by a rapid water quench (3000 °C/min), were spherical with an Al content of 6.2 wt.-%.\nSlower-cooled specimens (2.5 °C/min) exhibited larger cuboidal shaped γ' precipitates ( ∼800 nm) with reduced\nAl content (4.5 wt.%). Furthermore, a negative inﬂ uence on the corrosion resistance of IN738LC was found with\nincreasing rate of cooling, which is attributable to an increase in volume fraction and Al content of the γ'\nprecipitates.\n1. Introduction\nNi-based superalloys are used as a material for turbine blades in\naerospace gas turbine components because of overall strength at high-\ntemperature. These alloys were developed to resist mechanical prop-\nerties such as fatigue, creep deformation and surface deformation at\ntemperatures in the range of 750– 900 °C [ 1]. Such properties are at-\ntained through the development of a high volume fraction of an orderedstrengthening gamma prime ( γ') L1\n2precipitate phase, which has a\ncomposition Ni 3(Al,Ti) inside a disordered gamma ( γ) phase matrix\n[2,3]. The γ' precipitate morphologies and their size distribution have\nbeen well-documented [ 4]. Ni-based superalloys generally consist of a\nbi-modal γ' precipitate size distribution with a volume fraction of about\n35–60% [ 5]. The small secondary and tertiary γ' precipitates are formed\nupon quenching, are called cooling precipitates and the ratio of thesecooling precipitates exceeds 60% of the total volume. Coarser γ' pre-\ncipitates are often formed during slow cooling from the solvus tem-perature.\nIt has been reported that the precipitate size, distribution and their\nmorphologies depend strongly on cooling rate [ 6]. The growth of a\nprecipitate is limited at faster cooling rates; therefore, these precipitatesattain spherical morphology. Additionally, if the cooling rate is high\nenough, the γ' will precipitate in a monomodal morphology. In contrast,\nthe slow-cooled materials exhibit a multimodal precipitate size dis-tribution, which has been attributed to multiple bursts of γ′precipitates\nat various temperatures on cooling [ 7]. The ﬁrst bursts of γ′nucleation\nor primary γ′precipitates occur at high temperatures, i.e., below γ′solvus, because of high di ﬀusivity coupled with lower thermodynamic\ndriving force (undercooling) for nucleation. At higher undercooling, the\nthermodynamic driving force for nucleation (chemical free energy)\nincreases and the di ﬀusivity of γ′forming elements decreases, which\ncreates local supersaturation resulting in other bursts of nucleationforming secondary and tertiary γ′precipitates.\nResults from Sajjadi et al. [ 8] showed an increase in volume fraction\nof larger γ′precipitates with a decrease in cooling rate. It has also been\nreported that the volume fraction of the overall γ′precipitates can be\nsuppressed at high cooling rates. Babu et al. [ 9] studied the cooling rate\ndependent microstructure and composition of γandγ′phases. It was\nobserved that there was no compositional change in the larger pre-\ncipitates compared to the equ"

Introduction\nNickel-base superalloys, possessing exceptional mechanical\nproperties due to the well known strengthening of L1 2type\nγ0precipitates, are widely used for manufacturing aircraft and\npower-generation engine turbines. Recently, Co-base superalloys\nstrengthened by γ0(Co 3(Al,W)) with L1 2structure have gained\nsubstantial interest. A series of experimental [1–7]and computa-\ntional [8,9] efforts have been done to study the effects of alloying\nelements on the microstructure and mechanical property of the\nnew Co-base alloys, suggesting that Co 3(Al,W) has some simila-\nrities with that of Ni 3Al and can be practically used as the\nstrengthening phase of Co-base superalloys.\nHowever, in the Co –Al–W-base alloys, large amount of W is\nadded to stabilize Co 3(Al,W), leading to a high density. The γ0\nsolvus temperature is relatively lower compared with that of Ni-base superalloys, a big restriction on high temperature applica-\ntions. Efforts have been dedicated to improve the two-phase\nγ/γ0\nmicrostructural stability at elevated temperature. Ta is effective toimprove the\nγ0solvus temperature in ternary Co –Al–W system\n[3,4] . The γ0solvus temperature of Co –9Al–8W–2Ta–2Cr (at%)\nalloy is above 1050 1C which is slightly lower than that of Co –\n9Al–8W–2Ta (at%) alloy [3], while the γ0solvus temperature of Co –\n7.8Al –7.8W –2Ta–4.5Cr (at%) alloy is only 960 1C[4].I naC o –7.5Al –\n7W–xCr ( x¼13, 17, 21, at%) alloy system [5], the γ0solvus\ntemperature is decreasing as the Cr content increasing. It seemsthat the addition of Cr makes against the improvement of γ0solvus\ntemperature. With 8 at% Cr additions, the oxidation resistance of\nthis new type Co-base superalloys is approaching the level of\nMAR-M 509 at 800 1C[6]. Recent investigations by Shinagawa\net al. [7]indicate that substitution of Ni for W can stabilize the γ0\nphase and slightly increase the γ0solvus temperature, which is\nbeneﬁcial to decrease the density. Besides, a combined addition of\nCr and Ni to ternary Co –Al–W system can improve the γ0solvus\ntemperature [5]. It can be seen that the combination of alloying\nelements greatly affects the γ0solvus temperature of Co –Al–W-\nbase alloys. It is interesting to know the effect of a combined\naddition of N"

SEIDMAN, EUGENE SUN, and SAMMY TIN\nBoron additions to Ni-based superalloys are considered to be beneﬁcial to the creep properties\nof the alloy, as boron has often been reported to increase grain boundary cohesion, increase\nductility, and promote the formation of stable boride phases. Despite the importance, it is not\nwell understood whether these improvements are associated with the presence of elemental\nboron or stable borides along the grain boundaries. In this investigation, two experimental\npowder-processed Ni-based superalloys containing elevated levels of Nb were found to exhibit\nincreased solubility for B in the cmatrix when compared to similar commercial Ni-based\nsuperalloys. This resulted in an overall lower B concentration at grain boundaries that\nsuppressed boride formation. As the predictive capability of CALPHAD database models for\nNi-based superalloys have improved over the years, some discrepancies may still persist around\ncompositionally heterogeneous features such as grain boundaries. Improved quantiﬁcation of\nthe characteristic partitioning of B as a function of the bulk alloy composition is required for\nunderstanding and predicting the stability of borides.\nDOI: 10.1007/s11661-017-4380-7\n/C211The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International 2017\nI. INTRODUCTION\nEXCELLENT mechanical properties, such as high\ntemperature creep and fatigue resistance, along with\nhigh corrosion and oxidation resistance, while operating\nat high stress levels and elevated temperatures are the\nproperties that make nickel-based superalloys the mate-\nrial used for the ‘‘hot section’’ components in modern\ngas turbine engines.[1–9]These superior high temperature\nproperties can largely be attributed to the unique\nmicrostructure of Ni-based superalloys, which consists\nof ordered L1 2intermetallic precipitates c¢(Ni3Al)\ndistributed coherently within a disordered FCC A1matrix c(Ni) that provides substantial order and\ncoherency type strengthening by inhibiting dislocation\nmotion during plastic deformation. The composition of\nmodern Ni-based superalloys is complex and tends to\nincorporate a variety of elemental alloying additions.\nDiﬀerent concentrations of c¢formers Al, Ti, Nb, and\nTa in modern polycrystalline Ni-based superalloys are\nutilized to produce an optimized size and volume\nfraction of the c¢strengthening precipitates, as these\nelements will preferentially partition to the c¢phase and\nserve to lower the anti-phase boundary energy as well as\nstrengthen the precipitate’s resistance to dislocation\nshear.[10]However, elevated concentrations of these\nelements lead to some residual solubility in the cphase\nthat will serve as potent solid solution strengthen-\ners.[11–14]In conjunction with conventional refractory\nalloying elements, such as W, Mo, Cr, and Co that\nstrengthen the cmatrix phase through solid solution\nstrengthening, the overall chemistry of the alloy must be\nbalanced as excessive alloying may promote the forma-\ntion of various ordered Ni 3X as well as topologically\nclosed packed (TCP) phases, which can be detrimental\nto the properties due to their brittle nature.[15–17]\nMinor additions of grain boundary strengthening\nelements, such as C, B, Zr, and Hf, are typically\nintroduced to the chemistries of polycrystalline Ni-based\nsuperalloys, with the"

The recently reported Co–Al–W-base\nalloys exhibit similar c–c0two-phase microstructure and\ncomparable creep resistance to ﬁrst-generation Ni-basesingle-crystal superalloy at 900 /C176C, and are promising\ncandidates for high-temperature applications [3–5].\nIn an attempt to increase the c0strengthening eﬀect,\nwhich usually depends on a high c0volume fraction in\nc–c0two-phase alloys, the alloying eﬀects on c0solvus tem-\nperature have been investigated in Co–Al–W-base alloys[6–11] . In general, the c\n0solvus temperature and volume\nfraction were signiﬁcantly increased by Ta, Ti, Nb and V\nadditions, whereas secondary phases were observed amongcertain alloys due to the very narrow region of c–c\n0two-\nphase [4,6–8] . Creep research revealed a pronounced\nincrease of high-temperature strength with Ta addition,whereas quaternary alloys containing Ti yielded the best\ncreep resistance, which was ascribed to the high c\n0solvus\ntemperature and microstructural stability [4,9]. However,\nin contrast to the extensive microstructural studies, rela-\ntively limited work has been conducted to investigate\nhigh-temperature mechanical properties, in particular forcreep properties of Co–Al–W-base single-crystal alloys aspotential turbine blade or vane materials [4–6,12] . More-\nover, these investigations have been mainly conducted in\nternary and quaternary alloys at temperatures lower than1000 /C176C due to relatively low c\n0solvus temperature, and\nlimited attempts have been made to understand the creep\ndeformation mechanism [4,12,13] . Although c0directional\ncoarsening was observed in Co-base alloys and was gener-\nally diﬀerent from commercial Ni-base single-crystal super-\nalloys with negative misﬁt, its role in creep behavior andstrengthening remains unclear, especially at temperatures\nabove 950 /C176C[4,5,13] .\nIn our previous research, a Co–Al–W–Ta–Ti single-\ncrystal alloy was designed and investigated based on\nfundamental studies on ternary and quaternary alloys\n[8,10,14–16] .

Introduction\nIn the course of the last decades, c0-strengthened Ni-base super-\nalloys became the most common used material for high tempera-\nture applications, such as discs and blades in aircraft engines and\nindustrial steam turbines. Here, a combination of excellent\nmechanical properties (creep strength, ductility) and good oxida-\ntion resistance at high temperatures is required [1]. For this reason,\nconventional Co-base superalloys, which exhibit superior corro-\nsion resistance but inferior mechanical properties compared tocommon Ni-base superalloys, are used mainly in corrosive envi-\nronments or mechanically lower loaded regions of turbines [2,3] .\nHigh temperature strength of Ni-base superalloys results from a\nstable ternary Ni\n3Al compound with an L1 2structure, which\nprecipitates as a cuboidal so called c0-phase in the fcc c-Ni solid\nsolution [2,4] . Since 2006, a novel c0-strengthened Co-base super-\nalloy is under investigation exhibiting high temperature strength\nvalues in the range of Ni-base superalloys [5]. Strengthening can\nbe achieved by a Co 3(Al,W) phase in the c-Co matrix, similar to\nthe Ni 3Al phase in Ni-base superalloys [5]. Furthermore, the addi-\ntion of Ta or Ti results in c0-solvus temperatures higher than those\nof commercial Ni-base superalloys, such as Waspaloy [5]. It was\nalso reported by Sato et al. that the melting temperatures of poly-\ncrystalline Co–Al–W based alloys is 50–100 K higher compared to\nNi-based alloys [5,6] which would lead to increased processtemperatures of future turbine generations. Recent publications\n[7,8] conﬁrm that previous improvements in mechanical proper-\nties of polycrystalline alloys due to B addition [2,9,10] can also\nbe achieved for novel Co-base superalloys by means of grain\nboundary strengthening. Nevertheless, relatively poor oxidation\nresistance is still a major drawback of this new alloy system and\nhas to be improved signiﬁcantly, since lifetime of high temperature\nmaterials is decreased by oxidation as it impairs the mechanical\nproperties.\nCompared to Ni-base superalloys [11–15] , only very little re-\nsearch has been done so far concerning oxidation properties of\nc0-strengthened Co-base superalloys [16]. For this reason, Klein\net al. [17–20] recently investigated the long term oxidation proper-\nties and mechanisms of polycrystalline Co–Al–W based alloys\nbetween 800 and 1000 /C176C in air and revealed "

This particular\nstudy is focused on understanding the inﬂuence of Ta additions on the solidiﬁcation sequence, phase vol-ume fraction, distribution coefﬁcient and solid state partitioning parameter of this eutectic alloy systemby systematically investigating a series of experimental alloys with nominally constant overall levels of\nTa + Nb content but varying Ta/Nb ratios. Although many of the tendencies observed in these multi-com-\nponent\nc/c0–deutectic alloys are in agreement with trends observed in lower order model alloy systems,\nTa additions were found to signiﬁcantly modify solidiﬁcation characteristics of the alloys. The experimen-\ntal observations were also used to critically assess the predictive capability of thermodynamic database\ncalculations. Despite the qualitative agreement observed between the experimental results and predic-tions for relatively simple quaternary and quinary model alloys, comparison of the results for higher\norder, multi-component\nc/c0–deutectic alloys reveals notable differences.\n/C2112013 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\nNi-base superalloys possess an exceptional combination of\nchemical and mechanical properties at elevated temperature and\nhave been extensively used in structural components in gas tur-\nbine engines for propulsion and power generation applications\n[1–3] . Traditional polycrystalline Ni-base superalloys possess a\ntwo-phase microstructure consisting of a disordered c(FCC) ma-\ntrix and ordered intermetallic precipitates c0-Ni3Al (L1 2) and/or\nc00-Ni3Nb (D0 22) to provide order strengthening and/or coherency\nstrengthening, which accounts for the majority of their high tem-\nperature mechanical properties [4–6] . Based on the increasingly\ndemanding requirements for high temperature strength and corro-\nsion resistance, the compositions of these alloys have been highly\nengineered and reﬁned over the past 60 or so years. Modern poly-\ncrystalline superalloys usually contain more than ten major alloy-\ning elements to strengthen both the matrix and the precipitates bysolid solution strengthening, as well as minor amounts of carbon,\nboron and hafnium as grain boundary strengtheners [3,5,6] .\nAlthough many different polycrystalline Ni-base superalloys have\nbeen developed and optimized over the years to meet the require-ments associated with advances in gas turbine technologies, most\nof the changes have been incremental in nature. In many instances,\nthese modest improvements are achieved at the expense of manu-\nfacturing difﬁculties and cost.\nDirectionally solidiﬁed\nc/c0–d(Ni–Al–Nb) eutectic alloys were\noriginally considered as candidate materials for high pressure gas\nturbine ai"

Introduction\nCommercial Ni-base superalloys mainly consist of /H9253matrix\nand/H9253/prime(Ni3Al) two-phase structure, which is important for them\nto keep excellent high temperature properties. Al and Ti are thetwo of major /H9253\n/primeforming elements. The fraction of /H9253/primeincreases\nwith the increasing of the total Al + Ti contents. An increase inTi/Al ratio and /H9253\n/primefraction is beneﬁcial to strength increase [1].\nSubstitution of Ti atoms for Al atoms in the /H9253/primelattice increases\nthe lattice parameter, thereby increasing the lattice misﬁt andanti-phase boundary energy of /H9253\n/prime[2,3] , both of these effects\nresult in an increased /H9253/primestrengthening contribution. On the other\nhand, the /H9253/primephase with sufﬁciently high Al is stable, but when\nthe content of Ti is high, Ni 3Ti (/H9257) phase can be formed [4].\n/H9257phase has a hexagonal close packed (hcp) structure that is\nnon-coherent with /H9253matrix. Generally speaking, there are two\nmorphologies of /H9257that may occur, intragranular platelet mor-\nphology and cellular morphology. The effects of /H9257phase on\nmechanical property are dependent on its morphology and posi-tion [5]. The platelet /H9257phase is associated with loss of room\ntemperature ductility, while the cellular /H9257phase can lower the\nnotched stress rupture strength [5].\nRecently, a new concept was proposed to design Ni–Co\nbase superalloys for turbine disk application in the temperature\n∗Corresponding author.

This concept\nis based on combining the characters of two kinds of /H9253//H9253/primetwo-\nphase alloys, i.e., a Ni-base superalloy (U720LI) and a Co-basealloy, Co–16.9 wt.%Ti. Thus, the contents of Co and Ti in newTMW alloys are higher than those in normal turbine Ni-base disksuperalloys, as listed in Table 1 . Previous results indicated that\nsome Ni–Co base alloys with a /H9253//H9253\n/primetwo-phase structure have\nimproved microstructural stability, superior tensile strength andhigher creep resistance at temperatures below 750\n◦C than cur-\nrent U720LI [7,8] . On the other hand, it was also found that the\n/H9257phase forms in some TMW alloys due to high Ti content [6,8] .\nIt is known that mechanical property of disk superalloys is\ndependent critically on the microstructure, which is determinedby the compositions and heat tr"

Starting from an \nexisting Cr-free cobalt-based superalloy (Co-30Ni-7 Al-4Ti-3Mo-2W-1Nb-1Ta-0.1B at. %) with \na γ-γ’ microstructure, we create three alloys with 4, 8 and 12 at. % Cr additions. Chromium \nlowers the γ’ solvus temperature (from 1129 °C for 0 % Cr to 1075 °C for 12 at. % Cr) and alters \nthe γ’ precipitate morphology (from cuboidal-to-spherica l), but does not affect the coarsening \nkinetics (which follow the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner model). The alloys with 8 and 12 at. % Cr \nexhibit minor amounts of a Mo-rich intermetallic ph ase at grain boundaries after homogenization, \nand the 12 at. % Cr alloy displays an additional ~3  vol. % intragranular refractory-rich secondary \nprecipitates upon aging at 850 °C for 168 h. Atom-p robe tomography reveals that Cr partitions \nstrongly to the γ-matrix, with a partitioning coefficient of κ γ'/ γ = 0.33 and 0.26 for Cr additions of \n4 and 8%, respectively. These additions halve the c reep rate of the original alloy at stresses \nbetween 275 and 400 MPa, reflecting significant cha nges in γ’ precipitate composition, volume \nfraction, morphology, and rafting tendency.  \n                                               "

The alloy, which showsconsiderable hot ductility at temperatures ranging from 1160 1C to 1250 1C under compressive loading,\nexhibits zero ductility under tensile loading within this temperature range. The difference is attributed to\nthe fact that while compressive loading permits plastic deformation in spite of non-equilibrium liquidphase dissolution of γ′precipitates in the alloy, the occurrence of the liquation reaction results in\ninhibition of plastic deformation under tensile loading. Accordingly, while grain re ﬁnement through\nstrain-induced dynamic recrystallization occurred under compressive loading, within the same tem-\nperature range, the formation of new grains was prevented under tensile loading. This behavior is crucialduring high temperature processing of γ′precipitation strengthened nickel-base superalloys.\n&2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\nManufacturing of components for applications in the high\ntemperature operating environment of aero and land-based gas\nturbine engines requires the use of materials with excellent high\ntemperature mechanical properties and reliable hot corrosion\nresistance. Nickel-base superalloys are usually used for hot-\nsection gas turbine applications. The high temperature perfor-\nmance of nickel-base superalloys can be attributed to a combina-\ntion of solid solution strengthening by a careful selection of alloy\nchemistry, precipitation strengthening of the matrix by γ′and/or γ″\nphases, and improvements in grain boundary characteristics bythe formation of various carbide phases. Cast nickel-base super-\nalloys that are precipitation strengthened by γ′precipitates, such\nas IN 738 LC, are particularly suited for higher operating tempera-\ntures due to better microstructural stability.\nJoining and forming processes are important in the manufactur-\ning of gas turbine components. Recent developments in the joining\nof high temperature materials have led to the use of friction joining\nprocesses, including friction stir, linear friction, etc., which have\nproduced excellent joints in materials that are very dif ﬁcult to join\nby other conventional methods [1–4]. Also, forming processes, such\nas forging, extrusion and rolling, remain critically important in the\nmanufacturing of gas turbine components due to the possibility ofachieving high production volumes and various shapes [5,6]. Fric-\ntion joining and forming involve two major events. Firstly, the\nmaterials are rapidly heated (non-equilibrium heating) to the\nprocessing temperature, which usually results in drastic changes\nin microstructure. Secondly, the materials undergo signi ﬁcant\nplastic deformation under externally imposed stresses. Studies have\nshown that plastic deformation and hot workability of γ′precipita-\ntion strengthened nickel-base superalloys depend on the dissolu-\ntion behavior of the precipitates at processing temperatures [7,8].\nPrecipitation strengthened nickel-base superal"

We concluded that the Arti ﬁcial Neural Network model,\nrather than the strain-compensated Arrhenius model, describes thermal deformation behavior accurately under\nlarge strains during hot extrusion. Arti ﬁcial neural network, a data-driven machine learning approach, is more\nsuitable for predicting unknown deformation behavior in extreme conditions by data learning based on a knownexperimental dataset.\n1. Introduction\nNi-based γ′phase strengthened superalloys are widely used in\nmanufacturing advanced gas turbine disks and other hot components\ndue to their excellent high temperature performance [1]. However,\nhigh alloying (mass fraction > 50%) in superalloys can decrease theirplasticity, making it very di ﬃcult to control the microstructure during\nhot working [2,3] . Recent studies [4,5] show that when thermo-\nmechanical processing temperatures of hot isostatic pressed (HIPed) Ni-\nbased superalloys are below the γ′solvus, the microstructure changes\ngradually from the γ′dispersion structure to the γ+γ′duplex structure.\nTheﬁne grain γ+γ′duplex structure decreases ﬂow stress and im-\nproves plasticity of the alloy [6,7] .\nIt is of great theoretical and practical signi ﬁcance to study the\nthermal deformation behavior near the γ′solvus, including constitutive\nrelations, dynamic recrystallization kinetics, and microstructure evo-\nlution during thermal deformation. Thermo-mechanical simulation\ntests are usually used for this; however, for superalloys, it is di ﬃcult to\nperform these simulations under large strains below the γ′solvus. When\ndeformation temperatures are below the γ′solvus, there is some of γ′\nphase (volume fraction 10– 30%) in the microstructure, inhibiting dy-\nnamic recrystallization [8,9] . Even if true strain reaches 0.6, complete\nrecrystallization is still not obtained, and ﬂow curves do not reach\nsteady state. When true strain is above 0.6, cylindrical compression\nsamples may bulge or even crack [10]. Therefore, it is impossible to\nobtain the ﬂow curves from the beginning of deformation to steady-\nstate (at the large strain level) with thermo-mechanical simulation tests.\nLin et al. [11] proposed a revised model in which the relationshipsbetween the material constants in the Arrhenius equation and true\nstrain can be ﬁtted to a polynomial by strain compensation. This revised\nmodel can predict the e ﬀect of true strain on ﬂow stress. The ﬂow stress\nunder di ﬀerent true strains at a given temperature and strain rate can\nalso be predicted by the Arti ﬁcial\n Neural Network (ANN) model after\ndata training [12]. However, the accuracy of these two models in\npredicting the thermal deformation behavior at large strain conditionshas not been widely reported. In this paper, we established the strain-\ncompensated Arrhenius model and arti ﬁcial neural network models,\nand analyzed the thermal deformation behavior of the alloy under largestrains below the γ′solvus.

Addition of Re significantly influences \nthe γ' precipitate morphology, the γ/γ' lattice misfit and the γ/γ' microstructural stability during \nlong term aging. An addition of 2 at.% Re to a Co-3 0Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (all in at.%) alloy, aged \nat 900°C for 50 hours, reduces the γ/γ' lattice misfit by ~ 40% (from +0.32% to +0.19%, \nmeasured at room temperature) and hence alters the γ' morphology from cuboidal to round-\ncornered cuboidal precipitates. The composition pro files across the γ/γ' interface by atom probe \ntomography (APT) reveals Re partitions to the γ phase ( \u0001\u0002\u0003 = 0.34) and also results in the \npartitioning reversal of Mo to the γ phase ( \u0001\n\u000b = 0.90 ) from the γ' precipitate. An \ninhomogeneous distribution of Gibbsian interfacial excess for the solute Re ( Γ\u0002\u0003 , ranging from \n0.8 to 9.6 atom.nm -2) has been observed at the γ/γ' interface. A coarsening study at 900°C (up to \n1000 hours) suggests that the coarsening of γ' precipitates occurs solely by an evaporation–\ncondensation (EC) mechanism. This is contrary to th at observed in the Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb \nalloy as well as in some of the Ni-Al based and hig h mass density Co-Al-W based superalloys, \nwhere γ' precipitates coarsen by coagulation/coalescence m echanism with extensive alignment of \nγ' along <100> directions as a sign of micro"

On\nprolonged aging at 800 /C176C of the Co–10Al–5Mo–2Nb alloy, needle-shaped DO 19-\nordered precipitates with stoichiometry of Co 3(Mo, Nb) start appearing in the\nmicrostructure. In addition, growth of cellular domains from the grain bound-\naries featuring a three-phase composite lamellar structure could be observed.\nThese phases are fcc c-Co with composition different from the original matrix,\nCoAl with B2 ordering and Co 3(Mo, Nb) with DO 19ordering. All the phases\nexhibit well-deﬁned crystallographic orientation relationships. The decomposi-\ntion of the alloys depends on the solvus temperature of the c0phase. The Ni-\ncontaining alloy exhibits no phase decomposition until 100 h of aging at 800 /C176C\nwithout any signiﬁcant effect on c0volume fraction (76 %). However, at 950 /C176C,\nthe alloy decomposes leading to the appearance of four different phases\nincluding TCP phases: a Cr 3Si-type cubic phase, a hexagonal Laves phase,\nrhombohedral lphase, and solid solution of Co phase. The c–c0microstructure\nin the Co–10Al–5Mo–2Nb and Co–30Ni–10Al–5Mo–2Ta alloys is not stable at\n800 and 950 /C176C, respectively, on long-term aging. This shows that the measured\nsolvus temperatures (i.e., 866 and 990 /C176C) are metastable solvus temperatures.\nWe also report that the Ti-containing alloy exhibits superior stability with no\nevidence of either TCP phase formation or any other decomposition of c0pre-\ncipitates, even after aging at 950 /C176C for 100 h.\nAddress correspondence to E-mail: surendra.makineni@gmail.com\nDOI 10.1007/s10853-016-0026-1\nJ Mater Sci (2016) 51:7843–7860\nPage 2:\nIntroduction\nCo-based superalloys featuring a c–c0microstructure\nare receiving increasing attention as a possible alter-native to Ni-based superalloys due to their comparablemechanical properties and improved high-tempera-ture oxidation resistance [ 1–5]. Among these, alloys of\nCo–Al–W have been studied the most over the years\nthrough various methods such as alloying, processing,and evaluation of mechanical properties [ 6–8]. These\nalloys show uniform distribution of L1\n2-ordered c0\nprecipitates with cuboidal morphology and Co 3(Al,\nW) stoichiometry in a fcc c-Co matrix [ 9,10]. The\nmorphologies and volume fractions of phasesobserved in the microstructures of these alloys arehighly sensitive to alloying with elements like Ni, Ti,Mo, B, Cr, and Ta [ 11–16]. The thermodynamics and\nphase stability of the ordered c\n0structure have been\nstudied using density functional theory (DFT) calcu-lations by various groups [ 17–20]. These studies indi-\ncate that W is crucial for stabilizing the L1\n2structure of\nthec0phase giving rise to Co 3(Al, W) stoichiometry.\nThe high-temperature strength improves signiﬁcantlywhen Ta is added to Co–Al–W alloys. However, thepresence of W and Ta in these alloys leads to higher\ndensities (9.3–10.5 gm cm\n-3) compare"

Excellent agreement was found between experiments and thermodynamic modeling.This new thermodynamic database enables predictions of stable c-c¢compositions for a new\nclass of high temperature, high strength Co-base superalloys.\nKeywords CALPHAD, experimental phase equilibria, thermo-\ndynamic assessment\n1.Introduction\nAmong all structural materials, nickel-base alloys are\nunique for their ability to operate at 90% of their meltingpoint with substantial mechanical loads in chemically severe\nenvironments. Such metallic alloys reinforced with inter-\nmetallic precipitates form the basis of a wide variety of hightemperature and high strength structural materials. The\nrecent discovery of a stable ternary Co\n3(Al,W) intermetallic\ncompound with an ordered L1 2structure[1]provides a\npossible pathway for development of a new class of load-bearing Co-base high temperature alloys. The thermody-\nnamic coexistence of the c-Co solid-solution phase with the\nc¢-Co\n3(Al,W) phase, and the similarity of the lattice\nparameters of the two phases result in microstructures with\nsubmicron regularly aligned, coherent cuboidal c¢precipi-\ntates.[1,2]This microstructure is morphologically identical to\nthe microstructure of Ni-base superalloys, which enables\nCo-base alloys to possess high-temperature strength and\ncreep resistance comparable to that of the commercial Ni-base superalloys.[3-6]\nBased on the fact that the c¢-Ni3Al with the L1 2structure\nis very stable and the c¢phase exists in a wide composition\nrange in the Ni-Co-Al ternary system,[7]it is expected that\nthe thermodynamic stability of the c¢phase may be\nincreased by Ni substitution for Co. Knowledge of phaseequilibria and thermodynamic properties of the Co-Al-Ni-W\nquaternary system is of fundamental importance for better\nunderstanding the microstructure and subsequent property\nenhancement of Co-base alloys, as well as possibleimprovements to the current Ni-base superalloys with Coadditions.\nThe purpose of the present investigation is to develop a\nreliable thermodynamic description of the Co-Al-Ni-Wsystem in the Co-rich zone, which is an essential step forward\nfor full thermodynamic description of the Co-Al-Ni-W-X\n(X = Cr, Re, Ta, etc.) system. New experimental assessmentscombined with prior knowledge of relevant ternary and\nquaternary systems provide an improved understanding of\nphase equilibria in this quaternary system. The database willprovide a useful guideline for new classes of Co-base alloysand processing development. This paper is organized as\nfollows: ﬁrst, the information available on relevant ternary\nand quaternary systems is reviewed. Next, experiments aimedat resolving stable phases in uncertain regimes of the diagrams\nare reviewed."

The morphology of MC carbides does not change in as-cast alloys, as the C\ncontent is increased or the Zr is added. However, the Y/Ce additions promote the transformation of MC carbidemorphology from blocky to script-like type. Compared with that in as-cast alloys, there is no obvious change inthe morphologies of MC carbide or chemical compositions after heat treatment. The increasing of C content and\nthe addition of Zr or Y/Ce signi ﬁcantly decreases and increases the amount of the γ/γ′eutectic, respectively.\nAfter a solid solution treatment and subsequently a two-stage aging treatment, the γ′phase is characteristic with\ntwo kinds of shapes and sizes, and the volume fraction of cuboidal γ′phase is much larger than that of spherical\nγ′phases. More MC carbide and residual eutectic result from the decreasing of cuboidal γ′phase volume fraction.\nThe decrease in volume fraction of cuboidal γ′phase is principally responsible for the reduction of the stress\nrupture property. In addition, script-like carbide and residual eutectic remaining after heat treatment play thesecondary role in the degradation of the stress rupture properties. The less regularly arranged cuboidal γ′phase\ncan damage the stress rupture life to some extent. The spherical γ′phase re-dissolves into γ′matrix widening the\nspacing between large cuboidal γ′phase, and the addition of Zr inhibits grain boundary sliding and cracking;\nthese two facts are bene ﬁcial to the rupture elongation.\n1. Introduction\nThe importance of minor additions to the mechanical properties of\nNi-based superalloys has been well recognized [1,2] . It is reported that\nthe addition of minor elements such as C and Zr could improve stress\nrupture properties of Ni-based superalloys [3–8]. The C content a ﬀects\nthe morphology, size and distribution of carbides, which have an im-portant e ﬀect on the mechanical properties of IN792 alloy [9]. Theﬁne\nparticle-like carbides inhibit grain boundary sliding and dislocationmoving, which was thought to be the main reason for the better creep\nresistance with the alloy [10]; However, coarse or continuous script-\nlike carbides are detrimental because they provide the easy crack in-itiation sites and propagation paths [11,12] . The increase of Zr en-\nhances the volume fraction of γ/γ′eutectic, and it causes the risk of\nincipient melting during solution treatment [4]. The additions of Y/Ce\nare reported to be capable of improving the oxidation and hot corrosionresistances [13]. However, the e ﬀects of their additions on the micro-\nstructure and mechanical properties of Ni-based superalloys are not yetclearly studied.Minor additions are cited for a variety of possible strengthening\nmechanisms including decreased grain bou"

INTRODUCTION\nRECENTLY ,TMW series alloys have been success-\nfully developed in our institute (NIMS, Tsukuba, Japan)for turbine disk and compressor blade applications.[1–3]\nThe TMW alloys contain c¢-forming elements: Al and\nTi; matrix elements: Ni, Cr, Mo, Co, and W; and grain-boundary strengthening elements, such as B, C, and Zr.Typical TMW alloys contain c¢volume fraction of about\n45 pct to 50 pct, which is close to U720Li alloy\n(developed by Special Metals Corporation, Huntington,WV). In these TMW alloys, the Co content is higher\nthan 20 wt pct and Ti content is higher than 5 wt pct,\nwhile normal commercial disk alloys only contain up to20-wt pct Co and 5-wt pct Ti.\n[3]High amounts of Co are\nsuggested to restrain the formation of the gphase[4]and\nlower the c¢solvus temperature,[5]which allows a large\nprocessing window and reduces the stress induced bycooling or quenching. Thus, TMW alloys have good\nworkability, and they can be easily processed by casting\nand wrought routes.[6]Titanium can substitute easily for\nAl in the c¢phase for antiphase boundary strengthen-\ning.[7]As a result, TMW alloys with candc¢structure\nshow improved phase stability and higher strength thanthe U720Li alloy.[1,8]\nThe properties requirements for disk alloys are very\ncomplex, and the optimal mechanical properties can beachieved by controlling the microstructures, which are\nusually determined by the alloy’s composition and heat-\ntreatment condition. The chief microstructural param-eters in Ni-based disk alloys are the grain size, thefraction and distribution of c¢precipitation, andcarbide/boride precipitation on the grain boundary.\nThese parameters can be generally modiﬁed by subsol-vus or supersolvus treatments, cooling rate after high-\ntemperature treatments, and aging.\n[2,9]Since the TMW\nalloys are newly developed, the role of heat-treatmentcondition, especially the subsolvus and supersolvus\ntreatments, on microstructural evolution and tensile\nproperties is still unknown.\nOn the other hand, high Ti content and Ti/Al\ncompositional ratio ( >2 wt pct) in the TMW alloys\npromote the formation of the gphase (Ni\n3Ti) with a\nhexagonal close-packed structure (hcp) in preference tothec¢-Ni\n3Al.[1,2]The existence of the gphase has a\ndeleterious eﬀect on an alloy’s ductility.[10]Generally,\nthe formation of the gphase is strongly related to Ti\ncontent, Ti/Al ratio, and alloy composition.[2]In a\nprevious study,[4]we investigated the e"

HUANG, H.Y. LI, M. PREUSS, M. KARADGE, P. BOWEN, S. BRAY, and\nG. BAXTER\nThis article describes a comprehensive microstructural characterization of an inertia friction\nwelded joint between nickel-based superalloys 720Li and IN718. The investigation has been\ncarried out on both as-welded and postweld heat-treated conditions. The detailed metallo-graphic analysis has enabled the relation of hardness proﬁles across inertia-welded alloy 720Li\nto IN718 and morphological changes of the precipitates present. The work demonstrates that\ninertia friction welding (IFW) 720Li to IN718 results in a weld free of micropores and micro-cracks and no signiﬁcant chemical migration across the weld line. However, substantial dif-\nferences in terms of grain structure and precipitation phase distribution variations are observed\non each side of the dissimilar weld. The high c¢volume fraction alloy 720Li exhibits a wider\nheat-aﬀected zone than the mainly c¢¢strengthened IN718. Alloy 720Li displays only a small\nhardness trough near the weld line in the as-welded condition due to the depletion of c¢, while c†-\nstrengthened IN718 shows a soft precipitation-free weld region. Postweld heat treatment\n(PWHT) of the dissimilar weld at 760 /C176C, a typical annealing temperature for alloy 720Li,\nresults in an overmatch of the heat-aﬀected zone in both sides of the weld. The comparison of\nthe as-welded and postweld heat-treated condition also reveals that IN718 is in an overaged\ncondition after the stress relief treatment.\nDOI: 10.1007/s11661-007-9194-6\n/C211The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International 2007\nI. INTRODUCTION\nINERTIA friction welding (IFW) is a solid-state\nwelding process, which allows joining nickel-base super-\nalloys with a high c¢volume fraction or diﬀerent types of\nnickel-base superalloys. During IFW, one part isattached to a rotating ﬂywheel, while the second,nonrotating part is forced into contact with the rotating\none under hydraulic pressure. The kinetic energy stored\nin the rotating ﬂywheel is then transformed into heat atthe interface of the two parts. In this way, a suﬃciently\nhigh temperature is produced at the interface, which,\ntogether with the torsional forces and axial pressure,results in material being ejected, and a bond is formed.\nThe IFW is considered an attractive manufacturing\nprocess because of its suitability for mass production.More importantly, unlike electron beam welding, laserwelding, and other welding technologies, the IFW\nprocess is a solid-state joining process. As a result,\nproblems related to liquation such as occurrence ofmicroﬁssures,\n[1,2,3]precipitation of detrimental phases,intergranular hot cracking,[4–7]and porosity[8]can be\neither avoided or diminished. As a consequence, high c¢\nvolume fraction nickel-base superalloys, considered to be\nunweldable by fusion welding techniques, can be joinedby IFW. The IFW is widely used in the automotive and\npower generation industry.[9,10]In the aeroengine indus-\ntry, it is mainly used to join high-temperature materialssuch as titanium and nickel-base superalloys.[11,12]\nThe IFW of two diﬀerent types of nickel-base\nsuperalloys, namely, alloy 720Li to IN718, has beenundertaken in this study. Such dissimilar joints arehighly attractive for the aeroengine industry as they\nresult in signiﬁcant weight reductions while maintaining\nthe mechanical properties and required temperaturecapability.

Introduction\nThe MAR-M246 is a polycrystalline nickel-cobalt-tungsten\nsuperalloy developed by Martin Marietta Corporation, which\nbecame part of Lockheed Martin Inc. (USA) in 1995. This\nsuperalloy has been widely employed in rotors of automotive\nturbochargers and in high-pressure turbo pumps (Ref 1). The\ndensity of MAR-M246 superalloy is 8.44 g/cm3and the\nmelting range is between 1315 and 1345 /C176C (Ref 2). The\nMAR-M246 superalloy generally solidiﬁes with a dendritic\nstructure containing carbides and exhibits extensive interden-\ndritic segregation. A variant alloy, called MAR-M246 (Hf),\ncontains 1.5 wt.% hafnium, which is added as a carbide former\nand grain boundary strengthener. The as-cast microstructurecontains carbides and the gamma ( c)-gamma prime ( c¢),\neutectic, as well as the nickel-based matrix which is strength-\nened by solid-state precipitated c¢phase (Ref 3).\nSolution heat-treatments are commonly used for nickel-\nbased superalloys and play a key role for the application of\nthese materials at high temperatures (Ref 4,5). The purpose of\nthis heat-treatment is to solutionize the c¢phase in the cmatrix\nand eliminate segregation generated due to non-equilibrium\nsolidiﬁcation (Ref 6). Then, aging heat-treatments are applied\nto provide higher creep resistance by generating very ﬁne\nsecondary c¢particles with suitable size and distribution in the\ncmatrix (Ref 7-11). To achieve the best results in terms of\nmechanical properties, the temperature and duration of these\nheat-treatments must be carefully controlled.\nThe creep-rupture strength of superalloys is one of the\nmost signiﬁcant properties to consider during the material\nselection process. The high-temperature (760-1200 /C176C) creep-\nrupture characteristics of nickel-based superalloys are supe-\nrior to those of either cobalt or nickel-iron-based superalloys.\nCast nickel-based superalloys such as MAR-M246 main-\ntain high stress-rupture strengths at elevated temperatures.\n(Ref 12,13).\nThe aim of this work is to present the microstructural\nevolution of MAR-M246 superalloy submitted to different\nsolutioning and aging heat-treatments conditions, correlating\nand comparing the results with simula"

For \ncomparison, a multi -pass compression approach is employed to investigate the effect \nof strain rate on the flow stress and grain size evolution. By means of imposing \ndifferent strain rates, the  results show that the finest grain size corresponds to the \nsecond -pass strain rate of 0.1 s-1, while the coarsest grain size arises from a \ncombination of the first -pass strain rate of 0.001 s-1 and the second -pass strain rate of \n0.01 s-1, respectively. A bimodal grain size distribution easily forms under the \nsecond -pass strain rate of 0.001 s-1. The microscopic analysis discloses the critical \nroles of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) nucleation rate together with static \nrecrystallization (SRX) in control ling the grain size development .

Introduction\nRecent years have seen an increase in the application\nand use of three-dimensional (3-D) microstructural charac-\nterization methods. This increase, which has been docu-\nmented in recent issues of Scripta Materialia [1]and the\nJournal of Metals [2], is due in part to the partial or com-\nplete automation of experimental data acquisition. Readilyavailable desktop computational power has also contrib-uted to a reduction in the time needed to acquire experi-mental data. While the data acquisition side has madesigniﬁcant progress, the subsequent analysis of the data\ncontinues to be an area of intense research.Certain morphological properties of a microstructure,\nsuch as the connectivity of precipitates, and the true precip-\nitate shape, can only be determined by 3-D characteriza-tion techniques. Other characteristics, such as precipitate\nsize distribution and the number of precipitates, can be\nmeasured in two dimensions, but require geometricassumptions for stereological estimates [3]. Therefore,\nexperimental techniques that can be used to investigatethe 3-D nature of microstructures are necessary to providemore complete microstructural characterization. This isnot a new insight and researchers have applied 3-D charac-terization techniques throughout the development of the\nﬁelds of metallurgy and materials science. For example,\nin 1918, Forsman used serial sectioning to examine the3-D morphology of pearlite, and constructed a solid modelof cementite lamellae [4]. Although the manual collection\nof serial sectioning data is a laborious task and representsa signiﬁcant barrier to widespread usage of 3-D data, thereare other issues related to the subsequent handling of thedata that also require development.

Introduction  \nNickel base single crystal superalloys are widely used for turbine blades of jet \nengines due to their extraordinary  and stable mechanical properties at high \ntemperatures. The development  of single crystal superalloys  not only eliminates grain \nboundaries which are weak at high temperatures, but also increases the melting point \nof the alloys by removal of grain boundary strengthening elements such as  C, B and \nZr. As a result, the occurrence of recrystallization  will be very detrimental  to the \nmaterial’s mechanical  properties especially at high temperatures [1, 2] . The \nintrodu ction  of plastic deformation offers driving force for recrystallization.

(1) Thermalprocessing schedules are used to control which phases are selected during heat treatment processing,and how and where these phases form.\nThe precipitation of\ng9is one of the most important reactions in nickel-base superalloys, and is the\nfocus of all industrial heat treatments. The precipitation of g9is preceded by the development of a\nsupersaturated g-phase solid solution. Superalloy N18 has been documented to develop 35°C of\nundercooling prior to precipitation of g9. (2)\nIt is believed that g9particles precipitate in a series of nucleation events. (2) This process of\nprecipitation results in a multi-modal distribution of g9particle sizes in which each size fraction is\nprecipitated at different temperatures and from a different chemistry gphase. For supersolvus heat\ntreatments,theinitialnucleationeventiscontrolledbythenucleationkineticsofthefullysupersaturated\ngphase.Subsequentnucleationeventsarecontrolledbyresultsfromtheinitialprecipitation,subsequent\ncooling path, new g9phase nucleation kinetics, and diffusional growth kinetics of the previously\nprecipitated g9. Studies on superalloy Rene ´ 95 have indicated that the g9formed from the initial\nnucleation event makes up 85% of the heat treat precipitated g9in this material. (3)\nThe growth morphology of g9has been proposed to progress from spheres to cubes, to doublet of\nplates, to octet of cubes and then to thin plates. (4) These morphology changes are driven bythermodynamic driving forces, and misfit strains between the\ngand g9. Departures from these\nfundamental stable morphologies lead to the formation of solid state dendrites. Others have studied thechange in\ng9morphology during cooling, processing and heat treating (5,6,7) because of its significant\ninfluence on final properties.\nSuperalloyU720LIhasbeenpreviouslystudiedwithregardtocurrentproductionsubsolvussolution\nand aging heat treatment cycles. (8) This work has shown that g9develops a bi-modal distribution\nduring precipitation from solution heat treatments cycles. The relationship between g9size and\nmechanical properties has been reviewed and a new aging practice for subsolvus solution heat treatedU720LI has been identified for optimum mechanical properties.

Chung4\nFriction stir processing (FSP) of high softening-temperature materials such as nickel-based\nsuperalloys is considered to be dif ﬁcult. Laser heating of a localised area ahead of the FSP tool\nwas used to provide suf ﬁcient plasticity during the FSP of IN738LC nickel-based superalloy. The\nstir zone (SZ) microstructure of the friction stir processed and laser-assisted friction stirprocessed were characterised. Laser-assisted friction stir processing (LAFSP) produced a\ndefect-free pass, but FSP resulted in generation of a discontinuity in the SZ. Both lower volume\nfraction of partially dissolved γ\n′precipitates and coarser grain structure of SZ in LAFSP led to\nmore ductility of the SZ material and elimination of the defects.\nKeywords: Friction stir processing, Nickel-based superalloy, IN738LC, Stir zone, Laser heating\nIntroduction\nFriction stir processing (FSP) is a solid-state metal work-\ning technique based on the principles of friction stir weld-ing (FSW).\n1Friction between the tool and workpiece\ngenerates elevated temperatures, which lowers the ﬂow\nstress of the material and produces a signi ﬁcant degree\nof plasticity in the vicinity of the rotating tool. This, inturn, imparts substantial strain to the workpiece resultingin reﬁnement and modi ﬁcation of the microstructure.\n2–7\nAs reviewed by Mishra and Ma2and Ma,8FSP has dis-\ntinct advantages and has been used for fabrication of sur-face composite, homogenisation of powder metallurgyalloys, microstructural modi ﬁcation of metal matrix com-\nposites, obtaining high-strain-rate superplasticity andspeci ﬁc property enhancement in cast alloys. Friction\nstir processing of the cast alloys results in extensivegrain re ﬁnement, breakup and dissolution of the coarse\nsecond-phase particles and closure of the porosities. Inother words, it may result in conversion of the as-castmicrostructure to a wrought condition in the absence ofa macroscopic shape change and therefore, it has contin-ued to attract research interest.\n2,8–10\nIn the present study, as-cast IN738LC, a precipitation\nhardened nickel-based superalloy and one of most dif ﬁ-\ncult to weld superalloys, is subjected to FSP for localisedmicrostructural modi ﬁcation aimed at a speci ﬁc property\nenhancement. This speci ﬁc property is the weldability andthe details of the weldability improvement by applicationof FSP as a preweld treatment have been previously"
